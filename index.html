Our newfound freedom from the chore of hand computation makes it both possible and, Paul Lockhart argues in this wonderful new book, desirable to step back and reflect on the entire development of arithmetic over several millennia. What are numbers, how did they arise, why did our ancestors invent them, and how did they represent them? They are, after all, one of humankind&#x2019;s most brilliant inventions, arguably having greater impact on our lives than the wheel.

It presents information regarding these individuals' ideas and scientific discoveries, along with a sense of the historical context in which they lived.<br> <br> The book is divided into three sections that correspond to three eras in the history of the discipline:<br> *the founding period (1880s to 1920);<br> *the rise to prominence period (1920 to1960); and <br> *the modern period (1960 to the present).<br> Each section begins with an overview chapter describing the period in terms of key social, political, and historical events affecting educational theory, research, and practice. In addition, the overview chapters discuss major theoretical, methodological, and instructional contributions of the period and how they changed the course of educational psychology.<br> <br> The biographical chapters describe the scholar's major contribution in terms of theory, research, and practice and his or her legacy and impact. These descriptions portray these individuals as real human beings responding to historical events and social influences of their time in personal and collective ways that changed the nature and direction of the field.<br> <br> <i>Educational Psychology: A Century of Contributions</i> is a cohesive collection appropriate for graduate and advanced undergraduate students in educational psychology.<br></p><p><p><i>Besides being informative and authoritative, the book is fun to read.

Following up this discussion with observations and then scientific explanations of the outcome gives students a more in-depth understanding of the subject at hand. Furthermore, the authors POE strategy helps teachers gain insight into students thinking throughout the learning process. Practicing the POE strategy also serves preservice teachers who need to develop strong pedagogy as they attempt to engage students in science learning and understanding. The 15 chapters cover topics such as force and motion, pressure, light, floating and sinking, and solutions. Lessons include worksheets, scientific explanations of the concepts being studied, summaries of student responses during the field tests, synopses of research findings, and lists of necessary materials. In Predict, Observe, Explain, Haysom and Bowen make it easy for novice and experienced teachers alike to incorporate a teaching method that helps students understand and even enjoy science and learning.</p><p>John Haysom and Michael Bowen provide middle and high school science teachers with more than 100 student activities to prove scientific concepts. The powerful Predict, Observe, Explain (POE) strategy, field-tested by hundreds of teachers, is designed to foster student inquiry and challenge existing conceptions that students bring to the classroom.2011 The Washington Book Publishers Book Design and Effectiveness Second-Place Winner --Washington Book Publishers</p><h2>Napoleon: Soldier of Destiny</h2><p><p><strong>Written with great energy and authority&#x2015;and using the newly available personal archives of Napoleon himself&#x2015;the first volume of a majestic two-part biography of the great French emperor and conqueror.</strong></p> All previous lives of Napoleon have relied more on the memoirs of others than on his own uncensored words.&nbsp;This is the first life of Napoleon, in any language, that makes full use of his newly released personal correspondence compiled by the Napol�on Foundation in Paris. All previous lives of Napoleon have relied more on the memoirs of others than on his own uncensored words.<br><br> Michael Broers' biography draws on the thoughts of Napoleon himself as his incomparable life unfolded. It reveals a man of intense emotion, but also of iron self-discipline; of acute intelligence and immeasurable energy. Tracing his life from its dangerous Corsican roots, through his rejection of his early identity, and the dangerous military encounters of his early career, it tells the story of the sheer determination, ruthlessness, and careful calculation that won him the precarious mastery of Europe by 1807. After the epic battles of Austerlitz, Jena and Friedland, France was the dominant land power on the continent.<br><br> Here is the first biography of Napoleon in which this brilliant, violent leader is evoked to give the reader a full, dramatic, and all-encompassing portrait.<br> 16 pages of color and B&amp;W illustrations</p><p>Michael Broers is a professor of Western European history at Oxford University.

Broers succeeds admirably.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>New York Review of Books</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Does an excellent job of delineating the emotional and intellectual development of the Corsican general-turned-French emperor. Offers a wonderful sense of the genius&#x2015;and man&#x2015;who was so stunningly able to remake European boundaries and mores after the meltdown from the French Revolution. Among the plethora of Napoleon biographies, this is immensely engaging for lay readers.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Kirkus Reviews</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Relying heavily on a newly released body of Napoleon Bonaparte&#x2019;s personal correspondence, Oxford historian Broers (<em>Napoleon&#x2019;s Other War</em>) brings Napoleon to the brink of mastery of Europe in this first of two projected volumes.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Publishers Weekly</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;The great strength of Broers&#x2019;s book arises from its detail, empathy and even-handedness. He draws extensively on the newly edited volumes of Napoleon&#x2019;s &#x2018;Correspondence Generale,&#x2019; as well as the thinking of numerous contemporary scholars, whom he generously acknowledges. He presents his information clearly and sometimes even lyrically, though his pages nonetheless demand close attention.

As a theory of the nexus of social relations involving works of art, this work suggests that in certain contexts, art-objects substitute for persons and thus mediate social agency. Diversely illustrated and based on European, Polynesian, Melanesian, and Australian sources, Art and Agency was completed just before Gell&#39;s death at the age of fifty-one in January 1997. It embodies the intellectual bravura, lively wit, vigor, and erudition for which he was admired, and will stand as an enduring testament to one of the most gifted anthropologists of his generation.</p><p><br><strong>Alfred Gell</strong> is a former Reader in Anthropology in the London School of Economics.<br><br>"[This] is not only a contribution to anthropology but a subtle and original counterweight to the banalities of globalization theory."--<em>Times Literary Supplement</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Middle School: The Inside Story: What Kids Tell Us, But Don&#39;t Tell You</h2><p>Remember middle school?

In keeping with that idea, early Renaissance Italy was a key participant&nbsp;in the first great age of portraiture in Europe. As groundbreaking artists strove to evoke the identity or personality of their sitters&#x2014;from heads of state and church, military commanders, and wealthy patrons to scholars, poets, and&nbsp;artists&#x2014;they evolved daring new representational strategies that would profoundly influence the course of Western&nbsp;art. More than a mere likeness, the fifteenth-century Italian portrait was an attempt to wrest from the unpredictability of life and the shadow of mortality and image that could be passed down to future generations. </p><p><i>The&nbsp;Renaissance Portrait</i>, which accompanies a landmark exhibition at the Bode-Museum, Berlin, and The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York,&nbsp;provides new research and insight into the early history of portraiture in Italy, examining in detail how its major art centers&#x2014;Florence, the princely courts, and Venice&#x2014;saw the rapid development of portraiture as closely linked to Renaissance society and politics, ideas of the individual, and concepts of beauty. Essays by leading scholars provide a thorough introduction to Renaissance portraiture, while individual catalogue entries illustrate and extensively discuss more than 160 magnificent examples of painting, drawing, manuscript illumination, sculpture, and medallic portraiture by such artists&nbsp;as Donatello, Filippo Lippi, Botticelli, Verrocchio, Ghirlandaio, Pisanello, Mantegna, Antonello da Messina, and Giovanni Bellini. With abundant style and visual ingenuity, these masters transformed the plain facts of observation into something beautiful to behold.</p></p><p><b>Keith Christiansen</b> is John Pope-Hennessy Chairman of European Paintings at The Metropolitan Museum of Art. <b>Stefan Weppelmann</b> is curator of early Italian and Spanish painting at the Gem�ldegalerie in Berlin.*Starred Review* This excellent, sumptuously illustrated book accompanied the exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York that ran from December 2011 to March 2012. It has six introductory essays and analyzes 138 portraits in painted panels, pencil drawings, marble sculpture, and bronze medals. In time, Flemish realism brilliantly fused with Italian humanism to create a new sense of the value of the individual personality and to place a correspondingly high value on the portrait itself. This innovative art justified Hans Holbein&#x2019;s proud inscription on his portrait of Derich Born, who lacked only breath to seem truly alive and responsive: &#x201c;Add but the voice and you have his whole self, that you may doubt whether the painter or the father has made him.&#x201d; These Renaissance artists explored their ideal of beauty&#x2014;women with blonde hair, high foreheads, fair complexions, and long necks&#x2014;and also sought to reveal virtue, the inward character, through the subject&#x2019;s outward appearance. Techniques of portraiture evolved from the simple to the complex forms that have endured to the present day. In about 1425, subjects were depicted in stark profile or as dual portraits against a dark background. Later they were presented full face, establishing eye contact with the observer, set against a deeper space and an open window with an expansive background. Subjects might have a suggestive gaze or gesture, accompanied by symbolic animals and attributes, and a three-quarter pose that turned reflectively away from the viewer. These magnificent portraits justify Leon Alberti&#x2019;s claim that they bestowed eternal life and fame by preserving the memory and virtues of the subject: &#x201c;Painting possesses a truly divine power in that not only does it make the absent present, but it also represents the dead to the living many centuries later, so they are recognized by spectators with pleasure and deep admiration for the artist.&#x201d; --Jeffrey Meyers</p><h2>The Great Gatsby</h2><p>HarperCollins is proud to present its new range of best-loved, essential classics. &#39;I believe that on the first night I went to Gatsby&#39;s house I was one of the few guests who had actually been invited. People were not invited -- they went there&#39;. Considered one of the all-time great American works of fiction, Fitzgerald&#39;s glorious yet ultimately tragic social satire on the Jazz Age encapsulates the exuberance, energy and decadence of an era. After the war, the mysterious Jay Gatsby, a self-made millionaire pursues wealth, riches and the lady he lost to another man with stoic determination. He buys a mansion across from her house and throws lavish parties to try and entice her. When Gatsby finally does reunite with Daisy Buchanan, tragic events are set in motion. Told through the eyes of his detached and omnipresent neighbour and friend, Nick Carraway, Fitzgerald&#39;s succinct and powerful prose hints at the destruction and tragedy that awaits.</p><p>In 1922, F. Scott Fitzgerald announced his decision to write "something <i>new</i>--something extraordinary and beautiful and simple + intricately patterned." That extraordinary, beautiful, intricately patterned, and above all, simple novel became <i>The Great Gatsby</i>, arguably Fitzgerald's finest work and certainly the book for which he is best known. A portrait of the Jazz Age in all of its decadence and excess, <i>Gatsby</i> captured the spirit of the author's generation and earned itself a permanent place in American mythology. Self-made, self-invented millionaire Jay Gatsby embodies some of Fitzgerald's--and his country's--most abiding obsessions: money, ambition, greed, and the promise of new beginnings. "Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgiastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter--tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther.... And one fine morning--" Gatsby's rise to glory and eventual fall from grace becomes a kind of cautionary tale about the American Dream.<p> It's also a love story, of sorts, the narrative of Gatsby's quixotic passion for Daisy Buchanan. The pair meet five years before the novel begins, when Daisy is a legendary young Louisville beauty and Gatsby an impoverished officer. They fall in love, but while Gatsby serves overseas, Daisy marries the brutal, bullying, but extremely rich Tom Buchanan. After the war, Gatsby devotes himself blindly to the pursuit of wealth by whatever means--and to the pursuit of Daisy, which amounts to the same thing. "Her voice is full of money," Gatsby says admiringly, in one of the novel's more famous descriptions. His millions made, Gatsby buys a mansion across Long Island Sound from Daisy's patrician East Egg address, throws lavish parties, and waits for her to appear. When she does, events unfold with all the tragic inevitability of a Greek drama, with detached, cynical neighbor Nick Carraway acting as chorus throughout. Spare, elegantly plotted, and written in crystalline prose, <i>The Great Gatsby</i> is as perfectly satisfying as the best kind of poem.</p>This critical edition of The Great Gatsby draws on the manuscript and surviving proofs of the novel, together with Fitzgerald&#39;s subsequent revisions to key passages to provide the first authoritative text of one of the classic works of the twentieth century.</p><h2>A History of Blood Coagulation</h2><p>Comprehensive review of the discoveries and scientists who discovered the mechanisms of blood coagulation.

The volumes, with their insightful and perceptive commentaries, updated footnotes, wonderful illustrations, and sidebars---all judiciously researched---contain a veritable thesaurus of enlightening information relating to the Hebrew Bible within the cultural, ideological, and religious world of the ancient Near East. Notwithstanding their traditional approach to Scripture, I heartily recommend this series with enthusiasm.&#x201d; -- Shalom Paul<br><br>&#x201c;This is a unique and important commentary. It is a milestone in the collection and comparative interpretation of ancient Near Eastern texts, pictures, and other archaeological materials as well as geographical, historical, and cultural information as they relate to the Old Testament. There is nothing else like it available today. The interpretations provided are usually cogent and convincing. Where there is legitimate debate, the explanations generally show due caution. There will always be disagreements between scholars on such matters, but the many comparative and archaeological resources assembled in these volumes make it a veritable gold mine for those who desire to take the ancient context of the Lord&#x2019;s work and word seriously in their study, teaching, and preaching of Holy Scripture.&#x201d; -- Richard E. Averbeck<br><br>&#x201c;Biblical commentaries have traditionally explicated the text verse-by-verse. By contrast, evidence from the wider archaeological, institutional and literary context has typically been organized thematically. John H. Walton and his collaborators have combined these two methods, presenting the context verse-by-verse. They have done so in a responsible manner, which will satisfy both maximalists and minimalists as well as the majority of Bible readers who find themselves between these two extremes.&#x201d; -- William W. Hallo<br><br>&#x201c;The publication of the Zondervan Illustrated Bible Backgrounds Commentary: Old Testament marks a major step forward in the systematic integration of the textual and artifactual evidences from the ancient Near East that inform the context of Scripture.

Readers will find the visual materials particularly valuable, since often these are scattered in many diverse places. While there will always be disagreements concerning the interpretations of the data, the collection in a single source will be a boon to all.&#x201d; -- K.

Thank you very much. <br><b> Michael Aiello<br>MA student, Wilfrid Laurier University </b> </p><p></p> <p>The book, and the theory itself, offered some attractive tenets for aspiring researchers, specifically in terms of identifying personal biases or assumptions that may not be self-evident. While this is not unique to the theory, I found the attitude towards personal bias and the utility hidden within very welcoming, as it offers a potential tool as opposed to an inherent weakness. <br><b> Jason Molloy</b></p><b> </b><p><b><br> MA student, Wilfrid Laurier University </b> </p><p></p> <p>I&#x2032;d like here to praise the extensive focus on practical advice given in <i>Grounded Theory: A Practical Guide</i>. Rather than present grounded theory as a magic bullet that bypasses all the shortcomings of other qualitative research methods, Birks and Mills present the depth and frequency of the pitfalls, that research inherently contains... grounded theory will be given serious consideration when I begin looking at doing field work. <br><b> Russell Ramey<br> MA student, Wilfrid Laurier University </b> </p> <p></p><p></p> <p>I found reading <i>Grounded Theory</i> illuminating in a variety of ways. The activities provided throughout the book were highly informative in that they offered a practical method in allowing the reader to "play" with the some of the techniques presented in each chapter... I really had the chance to understand just how much qualitative information is able to surface, in regards to not only research data, but the way my own thoughts, assumptions and connections play in to the discoveries being made. For me, it was refreshing to know that it is encouraged to just let my mind "run wild," without having a specific question that needs to be answered... Overall, I absorbed that grounded theory, for me, has become the "orthodoxy" of qualitative research methods, and I very much appreciate Birks and Mills presentation of the text. <br><b> Keri Raif<br> MA student, Wilfrid Laurier University </b> </p><p></p> <p>Your book helped me find a love of Grounded Theory <br><b> Marisha McAuliffe<br> PhD Student, School of Design, Queensland University of Technology</b></p> <p></p></p><h2>An Introduction to Spanish-American Literature</h2><p>This is a revised, updated edition of Jean Franco&#39;s classic Introduction to Spanish-American Literature, first published in 1969 and much recommended ever since.

At the time, the U.S. was afraid of a nuclear attack by Russia -- the idea of an attack by a small country was so absurd as to seem comical. Wibberley's tiny European nation is furious about unfair U.S. trading practices, so they send an army to invade New York City, march up Broadway, and accidentally capture the world's newest and most destructive bomb.

Eugene Smith and the Photographic Essay</h2><p>This is the first in-depth study of one of the most important photojournalists of the postwar period in America. Examining the antecedents for the photo-essay, a genre that Smith perfected, Glenn Willumson closely analyses the four works that he produced for Life magazine, and for which he is best known: &#39;Country Doctor&#39;, &#39;Spanish Village&#39;, &#39;Nurse-Midwife&#39;, and &#39;Man of Mercy&#39;. In his study of these works, now acknowledged to set the standard by which the photo-essay is judged, Willumson also argues that Smith&#39;s essays are significant cultural documents. An engaging account of Smith&#39;s career, W. Eugene Smith and the Photographic Essay reproduces his work as it originally appeared in Life, making it accessible to a new generation.</p><p>An engaging account of Smith&#39;s career, W. Eugene Smith and the Photographic Essay reproduces his work as it originally appeared in Life, making it accessible to a new generation.Smith virtually defined the photo essay with his memorable 1948 Life magazine piece "Country Doctor." He continued his artful blending of words and pictures in three further Life assignments--"Spanish Village," "Nurse Midwife" and "A Man of Mercy" (on Albert Schweitzer)--but quit the magazine in 1954 to protest what he perceived as loss of "authorial control" over his work. He won additional acclaim as a freelancer, most notably for his reportage on Minimata, a Japanese town whose inhabitants were deformed by industrial mercury poisoning. Willumson, developer of the photography collection at the Getty Center for the History of Art and the Humanities in Santa Monica, Calif., analyzes in depth the production of and reaction to Smith's major photo essays, reproduced here in their original Life format. Admirers may be shocked by the author's ample documentation of the extent to which Smith and Life slanted research, manipulated scenes and doctored prints to enhance photo-reportage as "a weapon against injustice." Willumson depicts his subject, who died in 1978, as a sensitive loner romantically attached to social causes and stubbornly committed to long, arduous efforts for excellence. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Principles of Ambulatory Medicine (Principles of Ambulatory Medicine (Barker))</h2><p>Updated for its Seventh Edition, <b>Principles of Ambulatory Medicine</b> is the definitive reference for all clinicians caring for adult ambulatory patients.

Set in London in the year AD 2540 (632 A.F.&#x2014;"After Ford"&#x2014;in the book), the novel anticipates developments in reproductive technology, sleep-learning, psychological manipulation, and classical conditioning that combine profoundly to change society. Huxley answered this book with a reassessment in an essay, Brave New World Revisited (1958), and with Island (1962), his final novel. In 1999, the Modern Library ranked Brave New World fifth on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. In 2003, Robert McCrum writing for The Observer included Brave New World chronologically at number 53 in "the top 100 greatest novels of all time", and the novel was listed at number 87 on the BBC's survey The Big Read. What if the future was a tyranny, but one cleverly person intended to keep the mass of society unaware of this? The people would be provided with several distractions, daily life would be ruled by sex and drugs, and pervasive mass media would suppress the possibility of any original thought: in such a society the ruling elite would not need to fear any kind of rebellion. If you think that Huxley's vision seems to be the way things are in fact turning out, you're not the only one!</p><p>&#34;Community, Identity, Stability&#34; is the motto of Aldous Huxley&#39;s utopian World State. Here everyone consumes daily grams of soma, to fight depression, babies are born in laboratories, and the most popular form of entertainment is a &#34;Feelie,&#34; a movie that stimulates the senses of sight, hearing, and touch. Though there is no violence and everyone is provided for, Bernard Marx feels something is missing and senses his relationship with a young women has the potential to be much more than the confines of their existence allow. Huxley foreshadowed many of the practices and gadgets we take for granted today--let&#39;s hope the sterility and absence of individuality he predicted aren&#39;t yet to come.<p>The astonishing novel <em>Brave New World</em>, originally published in 1932, presents Aldous Huxley's vision of the future -- of a world utterly transformed. Through the most efficient scientific and psychological engineering, people are genetically designed to be passive and therefore consistently useful to the ruling class. This powerful work of speculative fiction sheds a blazing critical light on the present and is considered to be Aldous Huxley's most enduring masterpiece.</p><p>The nonfiction work <em>Brave New World Revisited</em>, first published in 1958, is a fascinating work in which Huxley uses his tremendous knowledge of human relations to compare the modern-day world with his prophetic fantasy envisioned in <em>Brave New World</em>, including the threats to humanity, such as overpopulation, propaganda, and chemical persuasion.</p></p><h2>The Community Development Reader, 2nd Edition</h2><p><p><em>The Community Development Reader</em> is the first comprehensive reader in the past thirty years that brings together practice, theory and critique concerning communities as sites of social change.

Paul Halmos thinks so, and you will too once you read this book. The Linear Algebra Problem Book is an ideal text for a course in linear algebra. It takes the student step by step from the basic axioms of a field through the notion of vector spaces, on to advanced concepts such as inner product spaces and normality. All of this occurs by way of a series of 164 problems, each with hints and, at the back of the book, full solutions. This book is a marvelous example of how to teach and learn mathematics by &#39;doing&#39; mathematics. It will work well for classes taught in small groups and can also be used for self-study. After working their way through the book, students will understand not only the theorems of linear algebra, but also some of the questions which were asked which enabled the theorems to be discovered in the first place. They will gain confidence in their problem solving abilities and be better prepared to understand more advanced courses. As the author explains, &#39;I don&#39;t think I understand a subject until I know the questions ... I wrote this book to organize those questions, problems, in my own mind.&#39; Try this book with your students and they too will be able to organize and understand the questions of linear algebra.</p><p>The Linear Algebra Problem Book is an ideal text for a course in linear algebra.

Drawing on a similar range of influences -- fashion&#39;s studied glamour, Larry Clark&#39;s haunting lowlife, and the casual beauty of the snapshot -- all five contributors realise their visions in contrasting and highly idiosyncratic ways. Nan Goldin is famous for her sexually polymorphous subjects, the way she transforms her models into Warholesque &#34;&#34;superstars&#34;&#34;, and her keen sense of irony and humour. Intimate Goldin associate David Armstrong works with stark black and white portraits of confession and loss. Mark Morrisroe is the tragic figure of the group, who died of AIDS age 30, a dark romantic whose work combined narcissism and explicit poetry. Jack Pierson is an impressionist, for him the photograph is a postcard sent from a &#34;&#34;pure moment&#34;&#34;. Working through an obsession with television imagery, Philip-Lorca DiCorcia stages and composes his models into images of mediated desire. This is the photography of a generation raised on television and chemicals, a stunning documentation of friendship, lust and love at the end of the millennium.</p><p>Text: German, EnglishThese three inexpensive volumes present the work of some of today's most interesting and accessible art photographers. Emotions &amp; Relations collects the work of five relatively established photographers who first came to know each other while in art school and the 1970s and have since sometimes been grouped as the "Boston School." While most members share similar content (their friends and acquaintances as subjects) and technique (lush, painterly uses of color), each demonstrates a clear individual style. This catalog to an exhibition at the Hamburger Kunsthalle makes a fine case for both their grouping and their specific talents, offering two short essays on the show and the "school" and introductions to each artist preceding the separate portfolios. While all five?Nan Goldin, David Armstong, Mark Morrisroe, Jack Pierson, and Philip-Lorca diCorcia?have published monographs, this volume offers new insights for substantial art libraries and a concise and beautiful compendium for small and medium public libraries. The German Tillmans and Japanese Mori are younger but still have impressive museum credentials under their belts. Mori's book accompanies a show traveling from Los Angeles to Pittsburgh and Chicago. Her stylized photos, using herself as subject in a variety of over-the-top costumes, at first simply entertain and make the viewer happy. But her juxtapositions of contemporary urban life and surreal fantasy also impart more disturbing thoughts. Tillmans's book, his fourth, is the most comprehensive collection of his work and finally captures the full variety of styles?from diaristic snapshots to painterly still lifes to off-the-wall fashion spreads. What unifies all this is an ability to see the ordinary and be astonished. Emotions &amp; Relations belongs in nearly all libraries; Tillmans is a fine choice for medium and large public institutions; Mori will be at home in larger public and academic art collections.?Eric Bryant, "Library Journal"<br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Beyond Singing: Blueprint for the Exceptional Choral Program</h2><p>(Methodology Chorals).

Our personalities are strongly influenced by what was happening around us when we were infants and whether our needs were met. Lundsted explains that our natal chart is our parent�&#x201a;�&#x2019;s transit chart, therefore revealing the truth of our childhood family dynamics. Once we understand these dynamics, Lundsted helps us move beyond laying blame on our parents by identifying the compensating strengths revealed in the chart. She also shows us that the typically classified difficult or hard aspects in the chart actually hold the key to our transformation.</p><p>Includes comprehensive description of all astrological signs, aspects, polarities, houses and case examples.

By the nineteenth century, they were perceived as dusty and dried up, &#34;dead from the waist down,&#34; as Browning so wickedly put it. In this erudite and entertaining book, a renowned literary critic explores the various ways we have thought about scholars and scholarship through the ages. A.D. Nuttall focuses on three people, two real and one fictitious: the classical scholar Isaac Casaubon who lived from 1559 to 1614; Mark Pattison, nineteenth-century rector at Oxford; and Mr. Casaubon in George Eliot&#39;s Middlemarch. The three are intricately related, for Pattison was seen by many as the model for Eliot&#39;s Mr. Casaubon, and he was also the author of the best book on Isaac Casaubon. Nuttall offers a penetrating interpretation of Middlemarch and then describes how Pattison recorded his own introverted intellectual life and self-lacerating depression. He presents Isaac Casaubon, on the other hand, as a fulfilled scholar who personifies the ideal of detailed, unspectacular truth-telling, often imperiled in our own culture. Nuttall concludes with a meditation on morality, sexuality, and the true virtues of scholarship.</p><p>In this erudite and entertaining book, a renowned literary critic explores the ways we have thought about scholars and scholarship through the ages. How is it, he asks, that in the nineteenth century, scholars became seen as dead from the waist down&#x201d; anemic and servile, impotent figures of ridicule?&nbsp;<p></p>&#34;Nuttall has written a book thoroughly alive and enlivening. It entertains, endlessly, but it also illuminates and returns emotion and love to scholarship and criticism.&#34;-Harold Bloom</p><h2>Journey to Hell</h2><p>Millions have read The Pilgrim s Progress and received inspiration for their Christian walk. Now, you can follow another man Mr. Badman on his life journey, which leads him ultimately to hell. In this allegory, the wickedness, depravity, and carnality in the life and death of Mr. Badman are contrasted with biblical standards of living and the path that leads to heaven. The wisdom of Mr. Wiseman will strike you as he explains a godly life in all situations including home, business, and <br>relationships. With this book, John Bunyan provides instructions for the Christian life. He will show you...<br><br> How to experience joy in difficult circumstances.<br> How to avoid the dire consequences of living a sinful life.<br> How to teach your children Christian values.<br> How to succeed in business.<br> How to be spared from God s judgment.<br> How to avoid bad marriages.<br> How to please God.</p><p>John Bunyan (1628 1688) was born in Elstow, England, and his life was<br>spared twice in his early years, something he believed God had done for<br>a special purpose. In November of 1660, when Bunyan arrived to preach<br>in the little town of Lower Samsell, he was informed that a warrant had<br>been issued for his arrest. Unwilling to renounce his Christian faith and<br>his calling to the ministry, he was imprisoned for twelve years. Among<br>the many writings he published during his imprisonment are The Holy<br>City, Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners, and the most famous, The<br>Pilgrim s Progress.

Over the last two decades, however, a contrary vision has emerged, one which sees the country's roots not in a state of "pristine" nature but rather in a "human-modified landscape" over which native peoples exerted vast control.<i>Fire, Native Peoples, and the Natural Landscape</i> seeks a middle ground between those conflicting paradigms, offering a critical, research-based assessment of the role of Native Americans in modifying the landscapes of pre-European America. Contributors focus on the western United States and look at the question of fire regimes, the single human impact which could have altered the environment at a broad, landscape scale, and which could have been important in almost any part of the West. Each of the seven chapters is written by a different author about a different subregion of the West, evaluating the question of whether the fire regimes extant at the time of European contact were the product of natural factors or whether ignitions by Native Americans fundamentally changed those regimes.An introductory essay offers context for the regional chapters, and a concluding section compares results from the various regions and highlights patterns both common to the West as a whole and distinctive for various parts of the western states. The final section also relates the findings to policy questions concerning the management of natural areas, particularly on federal lands, and of the "naturalness" of the pre-European western landscape.</p><p>Thomas R.

His first concern is with the fundamental problems of substance, space, and time; and the most interesting part of his discussion is, perhaps, his criticism of Einstein&#39;s method of interpreting results, and the alternative development of his own well-known theory of the four-dimensional &#39;Space-Time manifold&#39;. Although this book was first published over a generation ago, and the characteristic approach of philosophers to the problems of nature has changed considerably in the intervening period, The Concept of Nature has never ceased to deserve their careful attention. When the book first appeared, A. E. Taylor, writing in Mind, said &#39;The Concept of Nature is a great contribution to Naturphilosophie, far the finest contribution, in my own judgement, yet made by any one man&#39;; J. E. McTaggart in The Cambridge Review called it &#39;one of the most valuable books on the relation of philosophy and science which has appeared for many years&#39;, adding &#39;I am sure the study of this book will benefit metaphysicians.

The changing circumstances of the Chinese revolution provide the immediate context, but throughout his writing the author views Chinese anarchism in relation to anarchism worldwide.</p><p><b>Arif Dirlik</b> is Professor of History at Duke University. He is the author of <i>Revolution and History: Origins of Marxist Historiography in China, 1919-1937</i> (California, 1978) and <i>The Origins of Chinese Communism</i> (1989).&#34;A first rate piece of scholarship, accessible to both general readers and China specialists. . . .

Here are all of the people that can benefit from this book on body language: Employers Public speakers Doctors Human Resources Directors Poker Players Actors Students Employees Parents Teachers Entrepreneurs You! If you have ever interacted with another person, this book will be useful to you because our everyday interactions are filled with secret nonverbal cues just waiting to be uncovered. Because this book is based in real science, it will debunk some popular myths about lying. Lying Myth #1: If people look to the left, they are lying. If they look to the right they are telling the truth. Although there is some science about eye direction, which we talk about in the book. It is not the most reliable form of lie detection. The book will show you more accurate (and easier) ways to spot lies. Lying Myth #2: Liars can&#x2019;t look you in the eyes. On average, honest people will make eye contact during conversations about 60% of the time&#x2013;way less than you thought, right? Liars actually look you in the eye more because they want to seei f you believe their lie or not. Lying Myth #3: Emails and IM&#x2019;s are filled with lies because it is easier to lie when people can&#x2019;t see or hear you. In the book, I will tell you which of the following have the most lies: ___Emails ___IM&#x2019;s ___Phone conversations ___Face to Face interactions I&#x2019;ll give you a hint: Shockingly, we lie the MOST in phone conversations and the LEAST in emails. Why Is Lie Detection Important? It is important when we know we are being lied to because it can save us money, time and sometimes even our safety. This book can train you to get to the truth 80% to 90% of the time. That can save you money on a faulty house, from hiring a bad employee or making sure you know what is really going on with your child or significant other. Unfortunately, we are not good at detecting lies. We are only right about 54% of the time! That is a little better than a coin toss. We tend to assume the best in people and have a bias towards truth&#x2013;&#x201d;innocent until proven guilty.&#x201d; In Human Lie Detection and Body Language 101 I give a number of real life examples and tons of practical tips that you will be able to use immediately. For example, wouldn&#x2019;t it have been great to have known when Lance Armstrong was lying? Lance Armstrong Lies In his recent Oprah interview, Lance Armstrong&#x2019;s body language was off the charts with lies and inconsistencies. He constantly made the &#x201c;contempt&#x201d; microexpression, which you will learn about in the book and showed how he really felt about the interview. He also showed a dominant and aggressive body posture and seating position. His words said far less than in his body. You can learn how to decode these popular culture segments on TV and in real life.

An eloquent, emotional journey from darkness to light."&#x2015;<b><i><i>Kirkus Reviews</i></i></b><br><br>"Tavis Smiley has captured not only the spirit of the movement, but the Spirit of Martin Luther King, Jr. in his last days.

In the introduction, Smiley remembers how when he was growing up, he recited the speeches of Dr. King in order to "find his own voice." And what a voice it is. Smiley's narration is smooth, measured, and backed by a rich, authoritative tone that truly adds another level of sentimentality and familiarity to the audio.

Bethell, a reporter for the <i>American Spectator</i>, offers a history of property as an idea and a reality around the world. His sweeping narrative will appeal to fans of David Landes's <i>The Wealth and Poverty of Nations</i> and Jared Diamond's <i>Guns, Germs, and Steel</i>. Yet, in many crucial respects, <i>The Noblest Triumph</i> (the title comes from British philosopher Jeremy Bentham's line that property laws represent "the noblest triumph of humanity over itself") is better than both, displaying a keener understanding of human nature and of how incentives shape behavior. In a chapter sure to inspire controversy, Bethell argues that the Irish potato famines of the 1840s were due primarily to Ireland's lack of stable property rights in the 19th century. Full of astute observations and written with real clarity, <i>The Noblest Triumph</i> makes a unique and welcome contribution to the debate over why some countries thrive while others languish. <i>--John J. Miller</i>"Bethell's book is enjoyable...learned and amusing..." --<i>The New York Times Book Review</i><p> "...wide-ranging and elegantly written..."--<i>Wall Street Journal</i></p><p> "...bold and unconventional..." --Richard Pipes, <i>Commentary</i></p><p> "An intellectual milestone" --Hernando de Soto</p><p> "Mr. Bethell has written a clear, cogent book that both sums up and advances our knowledge of property.

They visited Berenson at his beautiful Villa I Tatti, in the hills outside Florence, and walked with him through the immense private library&#x2014;which he would eventually bequeath to Harvard&#x2014;without ever suspecting that he had grown up in a poor Lithuanian Jewish immigrant family that had struggled to survive in Boston on the wages of the father&#x2019;s work as a tin peddler. Berenson&#x2019;s extraordinary self-transformation, financed by the explosion of the Gilded Age art market and his secret partnership with the great art dealer Joseph Duveen, came with painful costs: he hid his origins and felt that he had betrayed his gifts as an interpreter of paintings. Nevertheless his way of seeing, presented in his books, codified in his attributions, and institutionalized in the many important American collections he helped to build, goes on shaping the American understanding of art today.<br><br> This finely drawn portrait of Berenson, the first biography devoted to him in a quarter century, draws on new archival materials that bring out the significance of his secret business dealings and the way his family and companions&#x2014;including his patron Isabella Stewart Gardner, his lover Belle da Costa Greene, and his dear friend Edith Wharton&#x2014;helped to form his ideas and his legacy. Rachel Cohen explores Berenson&#x2019;s inner world and exceptional visual capacity while also illuminating the historical forces&#x2014;new capital, the developing art market, persistent anti-Semitism, and the two world wars&#x2014;that profoundly affected his life.</p></p><p><b>Rachel Cohen</b> is the author of <i>A Chance Meeting: Intertwined Lives of American Writers and Artists</i>, winner of the PEN/Jerard Fund Award.

She keeps a notebook on looking at paintings at http://rachelecohen.com.<p>"A highly sympathetic and graceful portrait of Bernard Berenson, the art connoisseur and dealer who remade himself into a work of art, priced and priceless, which he protected, cultivated, and even at times bartered: Rachel Cohen's <i>Bernard</i>&nbsp;<i>Berenson</i> is an illuminating tale of this self-transformation, its successes and pitfalls, told with stalwart compassion."--Brenda Wineapple, author of&nbsp;<i>Ecstatic Nation: Confidence, Crisis, and Compromise, 1848-1877</i></p><p></p> (Brenda Wineapple)<br><br> <p>"An insightful, richly detailed account of Bernard Berenson&#x2019;s brilliant transformation from an immigrant Jew and son of a tin peddler into a connoisseur of Italian Renaissance painting and a dealer in secret partnership with Joseph Duveen.

She moved to Louisiana where she wrote two novels and numerous stories. Because <i>The Awakening</i> was widely condemned, publication of Chopin&#x2019;s third story collection was cancelled. <i>The Awakening</i> was rediscovered by scholars in the 1960s and 1970s and is her best-known work.This third and last short story collection, written between 1893 and 1900 and canceled by her publisher during the author's lifetime, now appears to increase our understanding of a woman who wrote daringly and unconventionally for her day. Her controversial novel, The Awakening (1899), has been assumed to be the cause for cancellation. Bayou Folk , her charming first story collection, dealt with Louisiana country people. In her second collection, A Night in Acadie , also set in Louisiana, she wrote for "seasoned souls" about adult realities. In this third volume, local color no longer matters--passions consume, romance explodes, and the spiritual pales. Most memorable are the women, the bold narrator who has drug-induced visions in "An Egyptian Cigarette"; the worldly actress Adrienne in "Lilacs" who seeks the serenity of the convent in annual visits, only to find her gifts ultimately rejected and Sister Agathe prostrate with grief; the wife who hears of her husband's accidental death in "The Story of an Hour" and exults in the prospect of absolute freedom. Though the themes and characters hardly seem shocking today, any reader or scholar interested in women's studies or period American literature will find this collection necessary.

When Jesus taught His disciples to pray, He gave them a model of prayer as an example to follow in communing with God.</p><p>In <i>The Prayer of the Lord</i>, Dr. R.C. Sproul helps us understand how to pray according to the pattern Jesus set for us. Each chapter focuses on a single line of the Lord's Prayer, shedding light on God's holiness and our need to humbly depend on Him. Dr. Sproul reminds us that as adopted children of God, we have an unspeakable privilege in prayer--to call upon our heavenly Father.</p></p><p><p>Dr. R.C. Sproul, the founder and chairman of Ligonier Ministries, is known for his ability to communicate the deep truths of the Christian faith. He is chancellor of Reformation Bible College, preaches at Saint Andrew's Chapel, and is the featured teacher on the daily radio program <i>Renewing Your Mind</i>. He has written more than one hundred books.</p><p>"Here is a very special book on prayer. It will not leave you overwhelmed with failure and crushed into "giving prayer yet another try"--as many books and sermons on prayer do. Instead, it will lead you gently by the hand--as Jesus did when He taught the disciples the prayer on which these pages are based. It will draw you into a sense of the privilege of prayer, stimulate new desires to pray, even leave you with a sense of the delights of prayer. These pages have an atmosphere of light and are permeated by a sense of freshness and joy. Happy indeed is the theologian who can stimulate prayer. And happy are we that R.C. Sproul is such a theologian. <i>The Prayer of the Lord</i> is--quite simply--a spiritual treat."</p>--Dr. Sinclair B. Ferguson<br><br><p>"R.C. Sproul has an amazing gift for explaining difficult truths in pithy, memorable, and easy-to-grasp ways. He is the ideal teacher for a study of the Lord's Prayer, because the prayer itself is a profound lesson on a difficult subject, given by Jesus to His disciples in an amazing economy of words. You will be greatly blessed and edified by this book."</p>--Dr. John MacArthur<br><br><p>"I love listening to R.C. Sproul teach, and this book sounds just like him--penetrating truths strikingly illustrated. His good quotations and pastoral wisdom make him as easy to read as he is delightful to listen to (and the short chapters help!). Sproul clearly explains the Scriptures with sentences that are simple and accurate. He knows enough to say important things concisely and clearly--truths about the kingdom, the fatherhood of God, history, and, of course, prayer. There's even a helpful question-and-answer section at the end. This little book now takes its place with the classics on prayer."</p>--Dr. Mark Dever<br><br><p>"Gospel-driven disciple-making in the church has historically made full use of the Apostles' Creed, the law of God, and the Lord's Prayer. Now through this marvelous and insightful exposition of the Lord's Prayer, R.C. has provided disciple-making Christians and churches with an excellent and useful instrument to direct and fulfill the heart's desire of every believer who would cry out, "Lord, teach us to pray."</p>--Dr. Harry L. Reeder III</p><h2>The Case of the Not-So-Nice Nurse (A Nancy Clue Mystery)</h2><p>When nurse Cherry Aimless lands in San Francisco in search of Nancy Clue and a flock of missing nuns, the earnest white-girl 1950s meet the oh-so-queer 1990s in a parody of both girl detective novels and lesbian romantic fiction. This latest edition has a new introduction by the author.</p><p>Mabel Maney is the author of the three books in the Nancy Clue series: The Case of the Not-So-Nice Nurse, The Case of the Good-for-Nothing Girlfriend, and A Ghost in the Closet (all available from Turnaround). She is also the author of two parodles featuring Jane Bond (James&#39;s lesbian twin sister): Kiss the Girls and Make Them Spy and The Girl with the Golden Bouffant. She lives in San Francisco.In this artful, hilarious send-up of girls' fiction of the past, innocent, naive recent nursing school graduate Cherry Aimless is drawn into pursuing a "case" when a beautiful patient in her psych ward mysteriously disappears after a visit by a nun. Cherry seeks the aid of forthright, courageous Nancy Clue, whose attorney-father has lately been done in by his housekeeper of 30 years. What is the clue in the book the missing patient gave Cherry? What happened to the conventful of nuns, presumed kidnapped, from which the visiting sister came? Where is Aunt Gertrude? Will our heroines escape the midnight prowler? the ticking time-bomb? And then there's the murder: will goody-good Cherry and her chums triumph? You bet, but along the way guileless Cherry has many peculiar things happen to her, all made shriekingly funny by her inability to distinguish drag queens and dykes from ordinary mortals. Many a fan of the (Cherry) Ames and (Nancy) Drew series will be delighted by this wonderfully wry parody--and rewarded by a not-bad mystery, too. <i>Marie Kuda</i></p><h2>The Last Man</h2><p><i>The Last Man</i> ends in 2100, "the last year of the world." A devastating plague has wiped out humanity, except for one man. This novel of horror, originally published in 1826, was rejected in its time and out of print from 1833 to 1963, when the first Bison Books edition appeared. Some critics now rate <i>The Last Man</i> more highly than Frankenstein, by the same author. This Bison Books edition offers a&nbsp;new introduction by Anne K. Mellor, who writes, "In our era of AIDS and biological warfare, Shelley's apocalyptic vision of an incurable plague that gradually destroys the entire human species resonates with mythic power."</p><p><p> Mary Shelley&#x2019;s third published novel, <em>The Last Man</em>, is a disillusioned vision of the end of civilization, set in the twenty-first century. The book offers a sweeping account of war, plague, love, and desolation. It is the sort of apocalyptic vision that was widespread at the time, though Shelley&#x2019;s treatment of the theme goes beyond the conventional; it is extraordinarily interesting and deeply moving. </p> <p> If <em>The Last Man</em> is in some sense a &#x201c;conventional&#x201d; text of the period, it is also intensely personal in its origin; Shelley refers in her journal to the last man as her alter ego, &#x201c;the last relic of a beloved race, my companions extinct before me.&#x201d; The novel thus develops out of and contributes to a network of story and idea in which fantasy, allusion, convention, and autobiography are densely interwoven. </p> <p> This new version of the first edition (1826) sets out to provide not only a thoroughly annotated text, but also contextual materials to help the reader acquire knowledge of the intellectual and literary milieu out of which the novel emerged. Appendices include material on &#x201c;the last man&#x201d; as early nineteenth-century hero, texts from the debate initiated by Malthus in 1798 about the adequacy of food supply to sustain human population, various accounts of outbreaks of plague, and Shelley&#x2019;s poems representing her feelings after the death of her husband.</p>Anne K. Mellor, a professor of English at the University of California at Los Angeles, is the author of <i>Mary Shelley: Her Life, Her Fiction, Her Monsters</i>.</p><h2>The Myth of Continents: A Critique of Metageography</h2><p>In this thoughtful and engaging critique, geographer Martin W. Lewis and historian K�ren Wigen reexamine the basic geographical divisions we take for granted, and challenge the unconscious spatial frameworks that govern the way we perceive the world. Arguing that notions of East vs. West, First World vs. Third World, and even the sevenfold continental system are simplistic and misconceived, the authors trace the history of such misconceptions. Their up-to-the-minute study reflects both on the global scale and its relation to the specific continents of Europe, Asia, and Africa&#x2015;actually part of one contiguous landmass.<br><br><i>The Myth of Continents</i> sheds new light on how our metageographical assumptions grew out of cultural concepts: how the first continental divisions developed from classical times; how the Urals became the division between the so-called continents of Europe and Asia; how countries like Pakistan and Afghanistan recently shifted macroregions in the general consciousness.<br><br>This extremely readable and thought-provoking analysis also explores the ways that new economic regions, the end of the cold war, and the proliferation of communication technologies change our understanding of the world. It stimulates thinking about the role of large-scale spatial constructs as driving forces behind particular worldviews and encourages everyone to take a more thoughtful, geographically informed approach to the task of describing and interpreting the human diversity of the planet.</p><p>If you consider geography an objective science, think again. According to Martin W. Lewis and Karen E. Wigen, even the concept of continents is open to interpretation. Why, for example, do Europeans consider their little peninsula a whole continent while the vast territories of India and China are mere subcontinents? Contrast this worldview with that of the Indian mapmakers who depicted South Asia as the world's largest land mass and Europe as marginalized "hat-wearing islands." During the Cold War, the world was even further divided, this time into first, second, and third worlds. But how you classify the various regions of the world, Lewis and Wigen posit in <i>The Myth of Continents</i>, depends very much on where you happen to be standing at the time. <p> Having bravely exposed the ethnocentrism at the heart of geography, Lewis and Wigen then offer up their own division of the globe based on "world regions" rather than continents. Under such a scheme, Europe would become Western Eurasia, while the Western Hemisphere would become North America, Ibero-America, and African-America (divisions based on linguistic, cultural, and/or racial criteria). Whether or not you agree with the authors' division of the world, <i>The Myth of Continents</i> is a lively and thought-provoking exploration of a subject many of us take for granted. After reading this book, you'll never look at a map of the world in quite the same way.</p>"Despite the recent surge of interest in geographical concepts and ideas, most social, cultural, and political studies are riddled with unexamined spatial assumptions. <i>The Myth of Continents</i> initiates a much-needed consideration of this state of affairs. Through a wide-ranging analysis of such metageographical constructs as East, West, Europe, and Asia, Lewis and Wigen provide provocative insights into the nature and significance of the ways we usually divide up the world. Moreover, they do so in an engaging and highly readable style. Readers of <i>The Myth of Continents</i> will never again see the world regions in quite the same way."&#x2015;Alexander B. Murphy, author of <i>The Regional Dynamics of Language Differentiation in Belgium</i><br><br>"An exciting, thoughtful, engaging, innovative book that demonstrates the need to reexamine commonly held assumptions about the world's division into continents, East/West, First/Second/Third World, etc. Readers will be drawn to its 'big-think' quality of shattering commonly held assumptions and to its up-to-the-minute contemporary feel."&#x2015;Benjamin Orlove, coeditor of <i>State, Capital, and Rural Society: Anthropological Perspectives on Political Economy in Mexico and the Andes</i><br><br>"An important and long overdue housecleaning of old geographical concepts, based upon an impressively wide reading of regional literatures."&#x2015;Edmund Burke III, editor of <i>Struggle and Survival in the Modern Middle East</i></p><h2>How to Think About Weird Things: Critical Thinking for a New Age</h2><p>This brief, inexpensive text helps the reader to think critically, using examples from the weird claims and beliefs that abound in our culture to demonstrate the sound evaluation of any claim. The authors focus on types of logical arguments and proofs, making <i>How to Think about Weird Things</i> a versatile supplement for logic, critical thinking, philosophy of science, or any other science appreciation courses.</p><p></p><h2>The Ring and the Book</h2><p><p>"With this book, M. H. Abrams has given us a remarkable study, admirably conceived and executed, a book of quite exceptional and no doubt lasting significance for a number of fields--for the history of ideas and comparative literature as well as for English literary history, criticism and aesthetics." &#x2013;Harry Bergholz, <em>Modern Language Journal</em></p></p><p><p>ISFN's <i>Classics Again</i> series hopes to bring great books that have been undeservedly forgotten back into the spotlight. We are delighted to have the opportunity to present you with a work that might have otherwise eluded your notice.</p><p> In June, 1860, Browning purchased an &#x201c;old yellow book&#x201d; from a bookstall in Florence. The book contained legal briefs, pamphlets, and letters relating to a case that had been tried in 1698 involving a child bride, a disguised priest, a triple murder, four hangings and the beheading of a nobleman. Browning resolved to use it as the source for a poem. The result, <em>The Ring and the Book</em>, is certainly one of the most important long poems of the Victorian era and is arguably Browning&#x2019;s greatest work. </p> <p> Basing their edition on the 1888&#x2013;89 version of the poem, Altick and Collins include the last corrections Browning intended before his death. In addition to a substantial introduction, this Broadview Literary Texts edition also includes selections from Browning&#x2019;s correspondence, and contemporary reviews and reactions to the work. </p></p><h2>When God Weeps Participant&#39;s Guide</h2><p>This moving Groupware product examines human suffering through the eyes and experiences of Joni Eareckson Tada, a remarkable Christian woman who's turned her own life experience into a powerful testimony to God's sovereignty and plan for all of us.<br><br>In six moving sessions, Joni explains her own outlook and experiences, from the tragic accident that left her paralyzed over thirty years ago to her brilliant ministry that touches people worldwide. The production follows Joni through her own everyday interactions with others, including her extraordinary "Family Retreats" that minister both to other disabled people and to anyone suffering and asking what God means by allowing it.<br><br>The life and everyday actions of Joni Eareckson Tada are inspirational in their own right. The combination of documentary-style video, individual stories of suffering and grace, and stimulating Leader's and Participants Guides make this a powerful stimulus for group discussion and individual reflection.</p><p><p>It's easy to trust God when things are going our way and the world makes sense. But when suffering strikes--especially seemingly senseless suffering--we are filled with doubt and stunned by events spiraling beyond our control. In the midst of suffering, we often question the very foundation of our faith--our belief in the God who says he loves us. </p><p>Since our trust and obedience rest on God's character, the questions that life's tragedies force us to face are difficult, even frightening. Who is God? Can he really be trusted? What are his purposes in the face of suffering? If he can stop suffering, why doesn't he? </p><p>Joni Eareckson Tada, a woman who has lived in a wheelchair for more than thirty years, and Steve Estes, a pastor and one of Joni's closest friends, explore the answers. When God Weeps is not so much a book about suffering as it is about God. It tackles tough questions about heaven and hell, horrors and hardships, and why God allows suffering in this life. </p><p>Through a panoramic overview of what the Bible says about suffering, the authors make clear who God is, why he permits so much heartache and pain, and how it is we can trust him. With both a practical edge and heartfelt warmth, When God Weeps offers a message of deep reliance on God--and keys to a radical, life-transforming dependence on his love and mercy in spite of our doubts, fears, longings, and questions. </p><p>It's a message much needed. Despair and discouragement are rampant. At the same time, fewer people are able to balance God's purposes and his mercies. Instead, attempting to avoid tragedy and suffering, many Christians confuse simple formulas for faith. But where does that leave the family who loses a son on a military mission? Or the young mother who isn't healed of cancer? </p><p>When God Weeps is for people like these . . . and for thousands more who need more--much more--than answers.</p>Joni Eareckson Tada, having been tutored in God's Word amidst the bruising reality of quadriplegia for over 30 years, is the author of over twenty books dealing with God's hand in hardship. The best-seller, Heaven, is her most recent book. She serves as president of JAF Ministries, a Christian organization which advances Christ's kingdom among the world's 550 million people with disabilities. She and her husband, Ken, reside in Calabasas, California. <p>Steve Estes holds Master of Divinity and Master of Theology degrees from Westminster Theological Seminary and Columbia Bible College. He is the senior pastor of Community Evangelical church in Elverson, Pennsylvania. He co-authored A Step Further with Joni Eareckson Tada in 1978 and authored Called to Die, the biography of slain missionary linguist Chet Bitterman</p></p><h2>Gray&#39;s Anatomy: The Anatomical Basis of Clinical Practice: 150 Anniversary Edition</h2><p>The original Gray&#39;s Anatomy...celebrating 150 years as the ultimate word in anatomical certainty</p><p><p>"In short, the 40th edition of <b><i>Gray's Anatomy</i></b> is not only the most complete textbook of anatomy on the market but is possibly the most complete anatomical atlas available." -<i><b>JAMA</b></i>, May 6, 2009--Vol 301, No. 17, pp. 1829-1830. </p> <p>"I am not aware of any book currently in print in any language that contains as much anatomical information as the 40th edition. it should be in the library of anyone who has the need for a comprehensive anatomical reference book.

Tough, righteous, a man on a mission. Only problem is, it's the wrong mission.</strong></p><p>With the <em>New York Times</em> bestseller <em>Kill My Mother</em>, legendary cartoonist Jules Feiffer began an epic saga of American noir fiction. With <em>Cousin Joseph</em>, a prequel that introduces us to bare-knuckled Detective Sam Hannigan, head of the Bay City's Red Squad and patriarch of the Hannigan family featured in <em>Kill My Mother</em>, Feiffer brings us the second installment in this highly anticipated graphic trilogy.</p><p>Our story opens in Bay City in 1931 in the midst of the Great Depression. Big Sam sees himself as a righteous, truth-seeking patriot, defending the American way, as his Irish immigrant father would have wanted, against a rising tide of left-wing unionism, strikes, and disruption that plague his home town. At the same time he makes monthly, secret overnight trips on behalf of Cousin Joseph, a mysterious man on the phone he has never laid eyes on, to pay off Hollywood producers to ensure that they will film only upbeat films that idealize a mythic America: no warts, no injustice uncorrected, only happy endings.</p><p>But Sam, himself, is not in for a happy ending, as step by step the secret of his unseen mentor's duplicity is revealed to him. Fast-moving action, violence, and murder in the noir style of pulps and forties films are melded in the satiric, sociopolitical Feifferian style to dig up the buried fearmongering of the past and expose how closely it matches the headlines, happenings, and violence of today.</p><p>With <em>Cousin Joseph</em>, Feiffer builds on his late-life conversion to cinematic noir, bowing, as ever, to youthful heroes Will Eisner and Milton Caniff, but ultimately creating a masterpiece that through his unique perspective and comic-strip noir style illuminates the very origins of Hollywood and its role in creating the bipolar nation we've become.</p> Color illustrations</p><p>Jules Feiffer is a cartoonist, playwright, screenwriter, children&#39;s book author and illustrator, and member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters. He teaches a humor-writing class at Stony Brook Southampton College and lives in East Hampton, New York.&#x201c;It&#x2019;s classic noir narrative to the bones, with all the required accouterments: the ceiling fans, the shadows, the tough guys, the morally ambiguous protagonist and the femme fatale, all drawn in Feiffer&#x2019;s signature dancing scribble. . . . Feiffer skates around characters, circling closer, retreating and returning to them, weaving the plot tighter until the pieces fall into place. This is pulp at its best. The book is subversive in a lot of ways&#x2015;from its occasional bursts of unflinchingly awkward content to its neat commentary on the graphic novel form itself, but it embraces popular culture influences without irony or apology. That may be the most subversive thing about it, actually. And the most romantic. . . . Two books in and Feiffer&#x2019;s noir graphic novel trilogy is starting to feel like a life&#x2019;s work. Smart, weird, political, engrossing; it&#x2019;s exactly the kind of morally complex story Cousin Joseph would have hated.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Chelsea Cain, <em>New York Times Book Review</em></strong></p><h2>You Gotta Have Wa: When Two Cultures Collide on the Baseball Diamond</h2><p>Offers an intriguing and often humorous look at the differences and similarities between the national obsession over baseball in Japan and in the United States and a detailed account of the game of &#34;besoboru.&#34;</p><p>&#34;Whiting has hit upon a brilliant way of demonstrating the very different psyche of our major trading partner across the Pacific.&#34;--The New York Times Book ReviewAn important element in Japanese baseball is wa--group harmony--embodied in the proverb &#34;The nail that sticks up shall be hammered down&#34;.

Toward the end of his life, Reverdy confirmed that the alienated, anxious &#x201c;thief&#x201d; of this novel in verse was a portrait of himself (&#x201c;Talant&#x201d; conveys both the dual echo in French of &#x201c;talent&#x201d; and the small town of Talan near Dijon, thereby evoking a potential plagiarizer from the countryside), and &#x201c;Abel the Magus,&#x201d; a semi-satirical portrait of Jacob.<br>Originally published in French in 1917, <i>The Thief of Talant</i> is a radical experiment in verse and narrative, a moving evocation of the loss (and recovery) of self and an encrypted guidebook to the &#x201c;heroic&#x201d; years of Cubism.<br><b>Pierre Reverdy</b> (1889&#x2013;1960) was a reclusive yet integral component of the early Parisian avant-garde and a friend to painters such as Modigliani, Picasso and Gris, who, with fellow poets such as Apollinaire and Jacob, came to represent a faction known as the &#x201c;Cubist poets.&#x201d; In 1926, Reverdy withdrew from Paris for a life of seclusion in the northwest of France.</p><p>Pierre Reverdy (13 September 1889 - 17 June 1960) was a French poet associated with surrealism and cubism. Pierre Reverdy was born in Narbonne and grew up near the Montagne Noire in his father&#39;s house. Reverdy came from a family of sculptors. His father taught him to read and write. He studied at Toulouse and Narbonne. Reverdy arrived in Paris in October 1910. It was there, at the famous Bateau-Lavoir in Montmartre that he met Guillaume Apollinaire, Max Jacob, Louis Aragon, Andr Breton, Philippe Soupault and Tristan Tzara. For sixteen years, Reverdy lived for his writing. Reclusive by nature, Reverdy began to distance himself from these circles, and in 1926, at the age of 37, he left Paris, converted to Catholicism and went to live in Solesmes, home of the great St. Peter&#39;s Abbey. He stayed there until his death in 1960.</p><h2>The Cambridge Companion to Early Greek Philosophy (Cambridge Companions to Philosophy)</h2><p>The Western tradition of philosophy began in Greece with a cluster of thinkers often called the Presocratics, whose influence has been incalculable.

Her new collection of poems, <em>Hello, the Roses</em>, is composed of three parts. The opening poems delve into an array of unities, of myth and landscape, fashion and culture, experience and forgetting, boys and ravens. The central poems explore an invisible world where plants, animals, and the self communicate and coexist. The final part contemplates the individual&#x2019;s relationship to night, weather, and cosmological time as Berssenbrugge limns a karmic temporal continuum, a mandala of perception. Throughout are the roses, transforming slowly, almost imperceptibly,deepening awareness, creating fields: a rosette of civilization &#x2015; a wild rose, a Delphic rose, imagined roses, white cabbage roses, an Apache rose, a Bourbon rose, our sacred mortality &#x201c;saturated with being&#x201d; in pink petals and gray-green leaves. <em>Hello, the Roses</em> is poetry enraptured with the phenomenal fullness of the world.</p><p><strong>Mei-mei Berssenbrugge</strong> was born in Beijing and grew up in Massachusetts. She is the author of twelve books of poetry, including <em>Empathy</em>, <em>Nest</em>, and <em>I Love Artists</em>. <em>A Lit Cloud</em>, her recent collaboration with the artist Kiki Smith, was published by Galerie Lelong in 2012. She lives in New York City and northern New Mexico.&#x201c;Every collection of poems by Berssenbrugge is a literary step forward. <em>Hello, the Roses</em>&nbsp;performs a quantum leap. The book is exhilarating. Thoughts, feelings, and perceptions churn. With her powerful command of words redoubled by a meditative patience, she captures a secret rhythm, into which she weaves lines that surprise us with their accuracy, their submission to experience.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Etel Adnan, <em>Artforum</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A vital hymn.

Even if you currently use a different version of the UNIX system, such as the latest release of 4.3BSD or SunOS, this book is valuable to you because it is centered around UNIX System V Release 4, the version of the UNIX system that unified many of the divergent UNIX implementations.</p> <p> For those professionals new to networking and UNIX system programming, two introductory chapters are provided. The author then presents the programming interfaces most important to building communication software in System V, including STREAMS, the Transport Layer Interface library, Sockets, and Remote Procedure Calls. So that your designs are not limited to user-level, the author also explains how to write kernel-level communication software, including STREAMS drivers, modules, and multiplexors.</p> <p>Many examples are provided, including an Ethernet driver and a transport-level multiplexing driver. In the final chapter, the author brings the material from previous chapters together, presenting the design of a SLIP communication package.</p></p><p>This book is for programmers who are interested in learning how to use the networking interfaces in UNIX System V Release 4 (SVR4). We use real-life examples to demonstrate how interfaces are used and techniques are applied. All too often in the workplace we find ourselves faced with new assignments for which we have little background. In these situations, we must educate ourselves as quickly as possible so that we can competently undertake the task at hand. Although technical manuals usually provide the information necessary to complete a task, they often lack the background, motivation, and explanation that help us to understand more clearly what we're doing and why we're doing it. <p>Intended as a practical reference, this book contains very little coverage of theory, and details better dealt with through manual pages are omitted, although references are used liberally. It could, however, be used to complement a graduate or advanced undergraduate course in networking. </p><p>As a prerequisite to reading this book, you should be familiar with the UNIX environment and the C programming language so that the examples can be understood. Some background in data structures and algorithms would be helpful, but is not required. </p><p>References to SVR4 manual pages are in the running text, appearing as the command name or function name, followed by the section of the manual in which the page is found, as in open (2). Here, we are referring to the open manual page in Section 2 of the system manuals. </p><p>Originally, there was only one manual for the system. With the introduction of each new release of the system, the manual grew in size until it had to be split up into separate manuals. In UNIX System V Release 3, there was one manual for users, one manual for programmers, and one manual for system administrators. </p><p>In SVR4, however, the manual pages were redistributed by functional area. The user commands are no longer in a single manual, nor can you find all the programming interfaces in one place. This new organization has proven difficult to navigate by novices and experts alike. The following summary should aid in the process of locating the desired manual pages. </p><p>Programmer's Reference Manual<br>(1) Commands relating to source code management, compilation, and loading<br>(2) System calls<br>(3, 3C, 3S, 3E, 3G, 3M, 3X) Most library routines<br>(4) File formats<br>(5) Miscellany (commonly used constants, data structures, and macros)</p><p>Programmer's Guide: Networking Interfaces<br>(1, 1M) Networking commands<br>(3, 3C, 3N) Network-related library routines<br>(4) Network-related file formats<br>(5) Miscellany, including network-related environment variables<br>(7) Networking drivers and modules</p><p>Programmer's Guide: STREAMS<br>(1, 1M) STREAMS-related commands<br>(2) STREAMS-specific system calls<br>(3C) STREAMS-specific library routines<br>(7) STREAMS modules and drivers</p><p>User's Reference Manual<br>(1) Commands any user might want to run</p><p>System Administrator's Reference Manual<br>(1M) Administrative commands<br>(4) Administrative file formats<br>(5) Miscellaneous facilities<br>(7) Special files (devices)<br>(8) Administrative procedures</p><p>You might find it helpful if these manuals are close by when you read this book.</p><p>BackgroundThe first standard network interface incorporated in the UNIX system was the socket mechanism. This mechanism was provided in the 4.2 release of the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) version of the UNIX operating system from the University of California at Berkeley. With it was an implementation of the Internet protocol suite (TCP, UDP, IP, et al.). These became available in 1983.</p><p>AT&amp;T did not address standard networking interfaces in System V until 1985, when it ported Dennis Ritchie's Streams mechanism from the Version 8 Research UNIX System to UNIX System V Release 2.0p, the unreleased predecessor to System V Release 3.0 (SVR3). With the release of SVR3 in 1986, STREAMS, the framework for networking in System V, became generally available, along with the Transport Layer Interface (TLI) library. Ironically, SVR3 was released without including any networking protocols. </p><p>In 1988, X/OPEN, a consortium dedicated to enhancing application portability through standards endorsements, specified its own transport layer interface library, based on AT&amp;T's TLI library. The X/OPEN specification, called the X/OPEN Transport Interface (XTI), is effectively a superset of TLI. In 1990 the Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) committee of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) created the 1003.12 working group to standardize portable networking interfaces for application programs. As of this writing, the 1003.12 working group's efforts are still underway, but it looks as though both sockets and XTI will be included in the standard.</p><p>SVR4 is unique in that it includes support for many standards in one operating system. Unlike other versions of UNIX that support dual-universe environments, SVR4 provides applications with one environment consisting of features from previous versions of the System V, SunOS, BSD, Xenix, SCO, and Research UNIX systems, as well as some new features of its own. Support for POSIX 1003.1 (the system application programming interface) is also provided. The major networking interfaces provided include STREAMS, TLI, sockets, and remote procedure calls. </p><p>OrganizationThe material covered in this book pertains mainly to SVR4, although some features were present in earlier releases of UNIX System V. This book is divided into four sections: background material, user-level network programming, kernel-level network programming, and a design example.</p><p>Both user-level and kernel-level networking components are described to present a complete picture of network programming in UNIX System V. Although not everyone will be interested in both environments, knowledge of one environment makes programming in the other easier. Instead of just blindly following the instructions in the manuals, it enables the programmer to understand the effects of his or her actions and make better design decisions.</p><p>The first two chapters provide some background that will make the rest of the book more useful to readers with less experience. More experienced readers can skip these introductory chapters without much loss of context. Chapter 1 provides a brief introduction to networking concepts, and Chapter 2 provides an overview of application programming in the UNIX System V environment. In particular, Chapter 2 contains example functions that are used throughout the rest of this text. If you skip Chapter 2, you might want to refer back to individual examples as you come across these functions in later chapters.</p><p>Chapter 3 is the first chapter concerned with network programming per se. It covers the STREAMS programming environment. Since the STREAMS mechanism is the basis for most of the communication facilities in System V, understanding its services and system call interface is a prerequisite to discussing any System V networking facility.</p><p>Chapter 4 covers the Transport Layer Interface library. This is the interface applications use to access the services provided by the transport layer of a computer network. Emphasis is placed on application design to support network independence.</p><p>Chapter 5 describes the network selection and name-to-address translation facilities, which further extend the ability of a programmer to design network-independent applications. Chapter 6 covers the network listener process. Using the listener simplifies the design of server processes. The Service Access Facility (SAF), the administrative framework in which the listener operates, is also discussed.</p><p>Chapter 7 gives a brief description of the BSD socket interface and its corresponding implementation in SVR4. The socket and TLI mechanisms are contrasted and compared. Chapter 8 discusses remote procedure calls and the external data representation used to develop distributed applications. This ends the user-level section of the text.</p><p>The next four chapters are dedicated to kernel-level network programming. Chapter 9 describes the kernel environment, its utility routines, and the interfaces to the STREAMS environment. Chapter 10 describes how to write STREAMS drivers, centering around the design of a simple Ethernet driver. Chapter 11 describes how to write STREAMS modules, centering around the design of a module that can be used to emulate a terminal over a network connection. Chapter 12 describes how to write STREAMS multiplexing drivers. It uses a simple connection-oriented transport provider as a detailed example.</p><p>Finally, the last section of the book, Chapter 13, covers the design of a SLIP package for SVR4, including both the user-level and kernel-level components. It illustrates the application of much from the preceding 12 chapters and, in essence, ties the book together.</p><p>Much of the interesting material lies in the examples.

David Mermin asserts that relativity ought to be an important part of everyone's education--after all, it is largely about time, a subject with which all are familiar. The book reveals that some of our most intuitive notions about time are shockingly wrong, and that the real nature of time discovered by Einstein can be rigorously explained without advanced mathematics. This readable exposition of the nature of time as addressed in Einstein's theory of relativity is accessible to anyone who remembers a little high school algebra and elementary plane geometry.</p><br><p> The book evolved as Mermin taught the subject to diverse groups of undergraduates at Cornell University, none of them science majors, over three and a half decades. Mermin's approach is imaginative, yet accurate and complete. Clear, lively, and informal, the book will appeal to intellectually curious readers of all kinds, including even professional physicists, who will be intrigued by its highly original approach.</p></p><p><p>"David Mermin's new book is a gem. Requiring nothing more than a basic understanding of algebra, it provides the clearest and most insightful treatment of special relativity I've ever encountered.

As the social contract becomes a distant memory, the new &#34;corporate state&#34; distances itself from workers and minority groups, who become more disposable in a new age of uncertainty and manufactured fear. This is the only book to connect the history, ideology, and consequences of neoliberal policies to education and cultural issues that pervade almost every aspect of daily life. A significantly revised and updated new version of Giroux&#39;s 2003 book, The Terror of Neoliberalism, this book points to ways in which neoliberal ideology can be resisted, and how new forms of citizenship and collective struggles can be forged, to reclaim the meaning both of a substantive politics and of a democratic society. Against the Terror of Neoliberalism was featured in the New York Times in the Stanley Fish blog: Stanley Fish Blog</p><p><b>Henry A. Giroux</b> currently holds the Global TV Network Chair Professorship at McMaster University in the English and Cultural Studies Department. He has published numerous books and articles and his most recent books include <i>America&#x2019;s Educational Deficit and the War on Youth</i> (2013) and <i>Neoliberalism&#x2019;s War on Higher Education</i> (2014). <b>The Toronto Star has named Henry Giroux one of the twelve Canadians changing the way we think!

[He] critiques the present of politics, as always, eloquently and yet clearly and pointedly, with theoretical sophistication, acute insights into the structures in which power operates, a careful reading of its contemporary manifestations as well as its historical roots, and an in-depth grasp of current academic debates. ... Against the Terror of Neoliberalism makes an incontrovertible demonstration of the ways that education is at the center of both how the forces of oppression gain ascendance and how the forces of dissent need to think [about] the future of opposition.&#x201d; <br>&#x2015;Robin Truth Goodman, Florida State University, in Symploke <br> <br>&#x201c;At the core of Henry Giroux&#x2019;s latest, and perhaps most incisive, encompassing and challenging book, Against the Terror of Neoliberalism, are urgent questions and concerns about youth, education, responsibility, the future, and democracy, all rigorously examined and captured brilliantly. ... [The book] should be obligatory reading across the spectrum of US education, from high schools and schools of education, to cultural studies, political science, union halls, military barracks, and departments of communications.

The design of this inventory allows examiners the flexibility to obtain information for measuring a reader&#39;s growth, assessing the effectiveness of specific reading approaches, and diagnosing specific literacy needs. As experienced teachers look for patterns of behavior to observe learner&#39;s strengths and needs. This can be accomplished with an assessment model that includes personal interviews and student reflection, observations, informal and formal tests and diagnostic teaching. The Bader inventory provides several valuable, research-based tools and guides to complement this assessment model balancing assessment practice without overtesting students.</p><p>Announcing this new text of the most comprehensive holistic inventory available. Based on the latest research in cognitive psychology, the field-tested, easy-toadminister tests of the Bader Reading and Language Inventory, offer future educators and educational diagnosticians a unique range of devices to identify reader abilities in five specific areas--Reading Readiness, Word Identification, Comprehension, Spelling, and Language.A great deal has been learned about factors that influence achievement in basic areas of functioning such as reading, writing and arithmetic. This knowledge is tempered with the realization that assessment of achievement, as well as the factors underlying achievement, is complex. But teachers of children, adolescents, and adults have instructional decisions to make, and those decisions are best made with diagnostic data. <i>The Bader Reading and Language Inventory</i> is a comprehensive diagnostic battery that encompasses vital areas of evaluation, is based on years of clinical research and practice, and is efficient to administer and interpret. The instruments within this inventory are specifically designed to assist teachers and specialists to discover conditions that inhibit learning and determine which intervention strategies can be used to improve learning. <i>The Bader Inventory</i> has been the inventory of choice for many who work with struggling readers, English Language Learners, and adult learners. This new edition has been carefully reviewed and revised to ensure it continues to meet those specific diagnostic needs. Included in this edition are additional resources to benefit practitioners.<br>NEW!&nbsp; A DVD now accompanies this inventory to allow first-time users to practice how to administer the inventory and its various tests and sub-tests. Readers observe tests being administered in a real setting and practice completing an Examiner's Copy data sheet at the same time as the DVD Examiner. They can then compare their completed data to the DVD Examiner's data sheet and determine if they understand how to use the inventory. Observation examples are provided for various grade levels. <br> <br>NEW!&nbsp; The Readers' Passages are now in the back of the text. Classroom teachers and clinicians can now create their own Readers' Passages booklet to assess children or adults. <br> <br>NEW!&nbsp; Reliability and validity statistics, collected over years of use of the Bader Reading and Language Inventory in clinic settings, are now included in Part Four of the text. The Bader passages and comprehension questions have been modified over time to ensure greater text reliability and validity and avoid test bias, especially for English learners.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; <br></p><h2>Parenting to a Degree: How Family Matters for College Women&#39;s Success</h2><p>Helicopter parents&#x2014;the kind that continue to hover even in college&#x2014;are one of the most ridiculed figures of twenty-first-century parenting, criticized for creating entitled young adults who boomerang back home. But do involved parents really damage their children and burden universities? In this book, sociologist Laura T. Hamilton illuminates the lives of young women and their families to ask just what role parents play during the crucial college years.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Hamilton vividly captures the parenting approaches of mothers and fathers from all walks of life&#x2014;from a CFO for a Fortune 500 company to a waitress at a roadside diner. As she shows, parents are guided by different visions of the ideal college experience, built around classed notions of women&#x2019;s work/family plans and the ideal age to &#x201c;grow up.&#x201d; Some are intensively involved and hold adulthood at bay to cultivate specific traits: professional helicopters, for instance, help develop the skills and credentials that will advance their daughters&#x2019; careers, while pink helicopters emphasize appearance, charm, and social ties in the hopes that women will secure a wealthy mate. In sharp contrast, bystander parents&#x2014;whose influence is often limited by economic concerns&#x2014;are relegated to the sidelines of their daughter&#x2019;s lives. Finally, paramedic parents&#x2014;who can come from a wide range of class backgrounds&#x2014;sit in the middle, intervening in emergencies but otherwise valuing self-sufficiency above all.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Analyzing the effects of each of these approaches with clarity and depth, Hamilton ultimately argues that successfully navigating many colleges and universities without involved parents is nearly impossible, and that schools themselves are increasingly dependent on active parents for a wide array of tasks, with intended and unintended consequences. Altogether, <i>Parenting to a Degree</i> offers an incisive look into the new&#x2014;and sometimes problematic&#x2014;relationship between students, parents, and universities.&nbsp;<br></p><p><b>Laura T. Hamilton </b>is associate professor of sociology at the University of California, Merced. She is coauthor of <i>Paying for the Party: How College Maintains Inequality</i>.&nbsp;&#x201c;Marshaling insights from the parents of a cohort of young women moving through a public research university,&nbsp;<i>Parenting to a Degree</i>&nbsp;shows&#x2014;in graphic, sometimes funny, sometimes heartbreaking detail&#x2014;how substantial parental investments are in what we often imagine is the ideal four-year college experience. It makes clear that persistence in college and early forays into the labor market are joint ventures between young people and their families, and that gender and class identities strongly shape how adults decide to support their children. These are pivotal contributions to our understanding of American higher education.&#x201d; (Mitchell Stevens, author of Creating a Class: College Admissions and the Education of Elites)<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Parenting to a Degree</i> offers a transformative account of why and how college parenting matters. A skillful and caring interviewer, Hamilton reports on how social class, gender, and cultural expectations shape parents&#x2019; varied involvement with their children&#x2019;s education. A pioneering contribution to the field of education.&#x201d; (Viviana A. Zelizer, author of Economic Lives.)<br><br>&#x201c;This book is a page-turner, revealing how daughters&#x2019; successful navigation of college so often depends on their parents&#x2019; continuing investment of intensive effort, money, connections, and knowledge. Parents&#x2019; varied visions and approaches, Hamilton vividly shows, often reproduce their own experiences and, in doing so, reproduce&#x2014;or deepen&#x2014;class inequalities. <i>Parenting to a Degree</i> is an outstanding contribution to scholarly work and should be used in today&#x2019;s pressing policy debates about inequality in higher education.&#x201d; (Naomi Gerstel, coauthor of Unequal Time)</p><h2>Thief: Prima Official Game Guide</h2><p>Pages: 384 Language: English Publisher: Random House Information G ...

M. Barrie's fantasy was published in 1906 with illustrations by the great Arthur Rackham. This meticulous re-creation of that rare and valuable volume features all of the original artwork that illuminated the text: 50 color plates as well as black-and-white tailpieces, headpieces, and more. Readers of all ages will delight in following the exuberant child through Kensington Gardens, where fairies dance to the music of his panpipes and teach him to fly.</p><p>Scottish author and novelist Sir James Matthew Barrie (1860&#x2013;1937) is best remembered as the creator of <i>Peter Pan</i>. Although he wrote several other books and plays that were extremely popular in their day, Barrie's lasting fame rests upon the stories inspired by a family of boys he befriended during an outing in London's Kensington Gardens.<br>A leading figure in the early 20th century's Golden Age of Illustration, English artist Arthur Rackham (1867&#x2013;1939) brought countless stories and fairy tales to life through his vivid imagination and eye for telling details. Rackham interpreted scenes from fairy tales, Wagnerian opera, and Shakespearean comedy. His memorable images, which combine whimsy, romance, and sophistication, continue to enchant children and adults alike.</p><h2>Basquiat</h2><p>Born in Brooklyn in 1960, Jean-Michel Basquiat lived to the age of only twenty-seven. His meteoric career as an artist had lasted no more than eight years. The one-time teenage runaway and high-school dropout was first included in a group exhibition in 1980, and almost immediately knew considerable success, enjoying his first solo exhibition just two years later. Basquiat quickly became a notable figure on the international art scene, mixing with dealers and artists. Among these was Andy Warhol, with whom he established a close working relationship.<br>Borrowing from graffiti and street imagery, cartoons, mythology and religious symbolism, Basquiat's drawings and paintings explore issues of race and identity, providing social commentary that is both shrewdly observed and biting. Characterized by their intensely personal nature and the raw, almost aggressive handling of paint, these works have an enduring power to move and to confound.<br>Viewing the heady world of the 1980s art scene from the beginning of a new century, we are able to look at Basquiat's achievements with increasing objectivity. Rather than explore his persona, this book aims to demonstrate the lasting quality of Basquiat's work itself, as well as its uniqueness within modern art. It strives not only to reevaluate his principal works, but also to explain Basquiat's continuing interest as a major painter.</p><p>Marc Mayer, formerly Deputy Director of the Brooklyn Museum, New York, is Director of the Mus�e d&#x2019;art contemporain de Montr�al. He is a noted critic and curator of contemporary art.<br>Each essay provides the reader with a different viewpoint on the man and his work, providing a critical insight for anyone who has an interest in Basquiat and the art world at the time he came to prominence in the 80's. &#x2014; <i>Magik City</i></p><h2>Discover Zen: A Practical Guide to Personal Serenity</h2><p>The latest title in our highly successful mind, body and spirit series, <i>Discover Zen</i> is a beautifully illustrated and inspiring guide to this ancient Asian philosophy.

It rapidly became a bestseller in the British Isles and Francophone Europe, with over 200 manuscripts surviving. Here, an authoritative version of the text is presented with a facing translation, prepared especially for the volume. It also contains a full introduction and notes. MICHAEL REEVE is Kennedy Professor of Latin Emeritus at the Faculty of Classics, University of Cambridge; Dr NEIL WRIGHT is a Senior Language Teaching Officer at the Faculty of History, University of Cambridge.</p><p>Director of Research, Faculty of Classics, Cambridge<br>This is surely going to be the all-purpose and long-awaited standard critical edition (...) which all medievalists will need to read and cite when dealing with what is one of the foundational texts of the Latin Middle Ages. MEDIUM AEVUM This fine edition will serve to make Geoffrey's Latin much more accessible and no doubt spur further research. Neil Wright's translation is graceful and precise. (...) It is wonderful to have a reliable Latin edition and translation of this important work priced for the library of the individual scholar and student. JOURNAL OF MEDIEVAL LATINA fabulous British history - giants and all - deserves its former bestseller status. Fresh and engaging, and can be enjoyed purely as mythical history. FORTEAN TIMES This new critical edition (...) is a major advance in scholarship and will undoubtedly become the standard text for the foreseeable future. SPECULUM This is a handsome volume and a major contribution to twelfth-century British studies. It will provide a firm textual basis for the next generation of scholarly research on Geoffrey of Monmouth and on twelfth-century historiography. JOURNAL OF BRITISH STUDIESThe Historia Regum Britanniae is a text of major importance for any folklorist interested in medieval folklore, national epics, and the invention of tradition. (...) For students and scholars wanting to read Geoffrey in the original Latin, or even just looking for a good translation of the book, Michael Reeve's and Neil Wright's edition and translation (.) is the best available edition of this influential text. FABULABR&gt; Praise for the original hardback: Reeve's new text, a collation of 11 of the most important manuscripts, is probably the best we've had since Geoffrey put his pen down, and it makes much previous scholarship redundant. (...) A definitive work for scholars. TOM SHIPPEY, LONDON REVIEW OF BOOKSThe text itself is beautifully edited, and the translation is extremely close to the Latin original without being stilted: all the energy of Geoffrey's prose shines through. CHOICE</p><h2>Dr. Jekyll &amp; Mr. Hyde</h2><p>In a story of good and evil, a gentle doctor&#39;s experiment into the duality of the soul goes awry and he is transformed into a hideous monster at night.</p><p>Mattotti and his longtime collaborator Kramsky return to the comix world with an interpretation of Robert Louis Stevenson's tale of gothic horror. While the story is set in Victorian England, Mattotti's artwork evokes the masterful expressionism of Berlin of the 1930s and such influences as Max Beckman, George Grosz and Giorgio de Chirico. Dr. Jekyll's obsession with the duality of the human personality-the good and evil that reside within-leads him to concoct the potion that brings out his purely evil side. Depicting this transformation, Mattotti's art becomes even more expressive, reminiscent of the later paintings of Francis Bacon. Jekyll's assertion that with his potion "Life would be relieved of all that is horrible" proves wrong. Indeed, he has distilled life's horrors in the person of the brutal Mr. Hyde, who haunts the nightclubs, parties, darkened streets and brothels of London, a perfect vehicle for Mattotti's masterful command of color, composition and mood. An accomplished colorist, Mattotti saturates the book's pages with a rich palette, and each panel is beautiful and expressive. Kramsky's adept condensation of Stevenson's book appropriates snatches of the original text verbatim, maintaining the power of Stevenson's prose while using a minimum amount of text. This is an impressive and vivid interpretation of Stevenson's timeless tale of the human spirit. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.The comic book has been a foremost medium of literary adaptation since the 1940s success of Classics Illustrated. Comics adaptations have been notably truer to their sources than their principal rival, the movies, though often less than graphically distinguished. Stevenson's great evil-doppelganger tale achieved its horrific effects by inference, but visual adaptations have made its violence explicit. Arnold L. Hicks' lurid expressionist cover for the first Classics Illustrated version of it provoked protest and was suppressed. Mattotti's virtuosic realization appears to have taken a cue from Hicks'. This is a visualization of intense colors, among which blood red predominates, deployed in the sweeping curves of dynamically drawn bodies, objects, and light effects. Faces and gestures recall the decadence-drenched caricatures of George Grosz, as do the settings on the evening streets and in the brothels and lower-class haunts of London. Odd angles of vision and psychologically resonant details deepen the aura of terror and corruption as they echo the paintings of Edvard Munch and the classic film of expressionist horror, <i>The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari</i>. Despite updating the story from the 1880s to the 1920s, Mattotti makes every other Jekyll-and-Hyde visualization seem inadequate. <i>Ray Olson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Thomas's detailed examination of Higham's evidence (including interviews with many original sources) convincingly shows that Higham quoted documents selectively, twisted witnesses' words and made a flawed case based on guilt by association: Flynn's prewar friendship with a bumbling Austrian doctor who spied for the Nazis in China. Thomas devotes two-thirds of the book to Flynn's defense; readers will wish that his gripping biographical sketch of the talented, lazy, hedonistic actor were more fleshed out. The volume concludes with a dispensable, albeit entertaining, epilogue by Patricstet Knowles, a friend of Flynn.

Westlake is one of the greats of crime fiction. Under the pseudonym Richard Stark, he wrote twenty-four fast-paced, hardboiled novels featuring Parker, a shrewd career criminal with a talent for heists. Using the same nom de plume, Westlake also completed a separate series in the Parker universe, starring Alan Grofield, an occasional colleague of Parker. While he shares events and characters with several Parker novels, Grofield is less calculating and more hot-blooded than Parker; think fewer guns, more dames.<br><br>Not that there isn&#x2019;t violence and adventure aplenty. The third Grofield novel, <i>The Blackbird</i> shares its first chapter with <i>Slayground</i>: after a traumatic car crash, Parker eludes the police, but Grofield gets caught. Lying injured in the hospital, Grofield is visited by G-Men who offer him an alternative to jail, and he finds himself forced into a deadly situation involving international criminals and a political conspiracy.<br><br>With a new foreword by Sarah Weinman that situates the Grofield series within Westlake&#x2019;s work as a whole, this novel is an exciting addition to any crime fiction fan&#x2019;s library.</p></p><p><b>Richard Stark</b> was one of the many pseudonyms of Donald E.

One man, hiding behind a deep laugh that made his own belly quiver, joked about being 'ruled by his stomach.' A woman spoke about her pitch-perfect intuition, inherited from her grandmother, allowing her to discern a situation 'from her guts.' Even pronouncing the word 'abs' caused people to physically adjust their bodies, shift forward in their chairs, or stand taller. Others grabbed their bellies, folding the flesh this way and that; or hid their midsection behind grim, folded arms. One woman wryly expressed interest in if I would be baring my own belly for the book's cover. <br> Joseph Pilates, the founder of the famous Pilates Method of body conditioning, saw the abdominal area as the center, or powerhouse, of the body. He perceived the powerhouse or 'girdle of strength' as the area between the bottom rib and the pelvis, the region that connects the abdomen with the lower back and buttocks. This circular belt of supporting abdominal and spinal muscles was for Pilates, who studied yoga and zen meditation, a mental and spiritual center as well as a physical, gravitational one. This is why there is talk in a Pilates class, as well as in other mind-body disciplines, of the importance of being emotionally, not just physically supported. To lose one's center is to become unhinged and unfocused, susceptible to the chaos of the world around you. 'Strengthening the powerhouse' is not simply about toning the waist or sculpting the perfect six-pack. It is about finding balance and serenity to live in the world as it is. <br> Why have I chosen a Pilates approach to Abs on the Ball even though some of the exercises presented here are not Pilates in origin? Notwithstanding the power of having a strong emotional center, the answer is a physical one. One of the key principles of the Pilates Method is that movement should be initiated from the Powerhouse. So before each Pilates exercise one braces the core by pulling in the navel and engaging the deep centering muscles. The goal is to keep the mid-section still while precise movements of the arms and legs are added. Each and every time! No wonder that participants new to Pilates first notice changes in their waistbands or that many in the fitness and rehabilitation world believe that the Pilates approach is the most effective and safe way to strong abdominals. Tummies flatten, pants hang loose, and low backs resist pain. But there is more going on here than meets the eye. <br> Magic, As Long as the Correct Muscles are Targeted <br> The Pilates approach will work its magic on your abdominal center as long as the proper muscles are taught to work. If the correct muscles are not targeted, and the exercises are not performed properly, the benefits of a secure back and optimal posture will not be guaranteed. Later, we will see how traditional sit-ups and ab machines actually limit the degree to which abdominal muscles can be trained. We will also understand how important it is that the body, specifically the pelvis, is in the correct position and the role that quality of movement plays in abdominal training. <br> Experts in the field of rehabilitation have known for a while that a strong abdominal core protects the spine but they were never completely sure how. In Rick Jernmett's excellent book Spinal Stabilization: The New Science of Back Pain, the role of the abdominals, especially the role that the deepest abdominal muscles have on the stabilization of the spine, is spelt out. He explains that the deep transversus abdominis attaches directly onto the spinal column and is thus able to 'stabilize individual vertebrae of the lower back, preventing excess sliding, bending, and rotation motions.' Jemmett, a physical therapist, lecturer, as well as golfer, runner and skier, reviews the latest research from Canada, the United States, Japan, and Australia on the role of the spinal column and its muscles. He concludes that various muscles of the spine have different functions. The deepest muscles and ligaments steady the spine and act as 'position sensors' supplying the brain with critical information on the position of the joints of the vertebrae. The next layer is the 'stabilizers', the deep muscles of the abdominals and back. These are the key players in the Powerhouse and their function is to stabilize the low back and spine and keep it free from pain. Finally, the outer layer consists of large superficial muscles, sometimes called the Prime Movers. The Prime Movers create powerful, one-off movements like extending the spine or lifting a leg or arm. The superficial muscles should be added into the picture only when the stabilizers provide a strong foundation for them. <br> As this important new information spreads into the fitness world more trainers and instructors are teaching the technique of 'bracing the abs' or 'moving from the core'. But before students and trainers alike can do this properly they need to make doubly sure they are targeting the correct muscles. How can the average person or athlete distinguish between a deep or superficial muscle? What will they feel if the correct connection is made? And once a deep muscle is located and trained how can it be integrated back into a healthy movement pattern?</p><h2>Horrorism: Naming Contemporary Violence (New Directions in Critical Theory, 14)</h2><p>Words like "terrorism" and "war" no longer encompass the scope of contemporary violence. With this explosive book, Adriana Cavarero, one of the world's most provocative feminist theorists and political philosophers, effectively renders such terms obsolete. She introduces a new word&#x2014;"horrorism"&#x2014;to capture the experience of violence. <br><br>Unlike terror, horrorism is a form of violation grounded in the offense of disfiguration and massacre. Numerous outbursts of violence fall within Cavarero's category of horrorism, especially when the phenomenology of violence is considered from the perspective of the victim rather than that of the warrior. Cavarero locates horrorism in the philosophical, political, literary, and artistic representations of defenseless and vulnerable victims. She considers both terror and horror on the battlefields of the <i>Iliad</i>, in the decapitation of Medusa, and in the murder of Medea's children. In the modern arena, she forges a link between horror, extermination, and massacre, especially the Nazi death camps, and revisits the work of Primo Levi, Hannah Arendt's thesis on totalitarianism, and Arendt's debate with Georges Bataille on the estheticization of violence and cruelty. <br><br>In applying the horroristic paradigm to the current phenomena of suicide bombers, torturers, and hypertechnological warfare, Cavarero integrates Susan Sontag's views on photography and the eroticization of horror, as well as ideas on violence and the state advanced by Thomas Hobbes and Carl Schmitt. Through her searing analysis, Caverero proves that violence against the helpless claims a specific vocabulary, one that has been known for millennia, and not just to the Western tradition. Where common language fails to form a picture of atrocity, horrorism paints a brilliant portrait of its vivid reality.</p><p>In this brilliant book, one of the world's most provocative feminist theorists and political philosophers introduces a new word&#x2014;<i>horrorism</i>&#x2014;to capture the experience of violence.

Author Letter</b> </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Dear Colleague, </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>I am very happy to have had the chance to prepare a third edition of <i>Living Religions: A Brief Introduction</i>, for even though the eternal values embedded in religions remain the same, the social and historical circumstances surrounding them as well as the scholarship pertaining to them are changing rapidly. To update the text I&#x2019;ve taken the help of many reviewers and a new team of excellent special consultants from a variety of academic institutions. I&#x2019;ve also continued to travel, speak with, and worship with people of all faiths around the world, including the continual flow of people of all religions through our Gobind Sadan Institute for Advanced Studies in Comparative Religion in New Delhi. In this unique interfaith, international community I am privileged to meet scholars of all traditions and to live among Russian Orthodox and Protestant Christians, Tibetan Buddhist nuns, Muslims, Sikhs, and Hindus. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>This edition includes perspectives gleaned from another visit to China, where I met Daoist nuns, Christian pastors, and the national leaders of thriving Buddhist organizations. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In Turkey, I witnessed the revival of religious interest but also the contemporary tensions between religious beliefs and the government&#x2019;s officially secular policy. Muslim friends took me to the well-preserved ruins of Ephesus, and the grotto nearby where Mary, mother of Jesus, is believed to have been brought by John the Beloved Disciple to live her last years.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Religions are so lively today that there is much to share. This new edition therefore includes new material on the encounter between science and religion, the impact of globalization on indigenous religions and more material on African religions as well as the "Great Reversal" in Christianity. It includes increased coverage of Buddhism in China, the latest in academic debates about the Indus Valley Civilization and the origin of the Vedas. There is more on socially engaged Buddhism, the latest scholarship on organized and folk Daoism in China and the interactions between Shinto, Buddhist, and Confucian ways in Japan as well as updated material on contemporary Israel. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>I have extensively revised the chapter on Christianity using new historical and biblical scholarship and more coverage of developing trends such as Evangelicalism and Pentecostalism. Looking deeper into the past as well as the present, I have revised the text on pre-Islamic Arabia, Islam in the West, and Islam in politics and offered a new feature box on the courageous Nobel Prize winner Shirin Ebadi of Iran. Among the many changes in the chapter on new religious movements I&#x2019;ve developed a section on the recently deceased charismatic leader Sathya Sai Baba and prepared a new interview box featuring a German practitioner of Transcendental Meditation. New material in the last chapter includes expanded discussions of globalization, secularism, and religions&#x2019; engagement with social issues.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>I hope that your students will find this new edition of <i>Living Religions: A Brief Introduction</i> accurate, informative, and thought-provoking, and that it will increase their awareness and appreciation of all religions, including their own. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Sincerely, </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Mary Pat Fisher</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Gobind Sadan Institute for Advanced Studies in Comparative Religion, New Delhi </p> <p> Marypfisher@hotmail.com </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p> <b>&nbsp;</b> </p> <p> <b>&nbsp;</b> </p></p><h2>Introduction to Ergonomics, Third Edition</h2><p><p>The past decade has seen the development and testing of an increasingly large set of ergonomics tools.

When she's not traipsing after a rabbit into Wonderland, she's gallivanting off into the topsy-turvy world behind the drawing-room looking glass. In <i>Through the Looking Glass</i>, Lewis Carroll's masterful and zany sequel to <i>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</i>, she makes more eccentric acquaintances, including Tweedledee and Tweedledum, the White Queen, and a somewhat grumpy Humpty Dumpty. Through a giant and elaborate chess game, Alice explores this odd country, where one must eat dry biscuits to quench thirst, and run like the wind to stay in one place. As in life, Alice must stay on her toes to learn the rules of this game. <i>Through the Looking Glass</i> immediately took its rightful place beside its partner on the shelf of eternal classics. And luckily for generations of enraptured children, Carroll was again able to persuade John Tenniel to create the fantastic woodblock engravings that have become so indelibly associated with the Alice stories. For almost 130 years, Alice's curious adventures have amused, perplexed, and delighted readers, young and old. This gorgeous, deluxe boxed set of both volumes contains engravings from Tenniel's original woodblocks that were discovered in a London bank in 1985, and reproduced for the first time here.

Full of pungency and wit, this luminous work is Bulgakov&#39;s crowning achievement, skilfully blending magical and realistic elements, grotesque situations and major ethical concerns. Written during the darkest period of Stalin&#39;s repressive reign and a devastating satire of Soviet life, it combines two distinct yet interwoven parts, one set in contemporary Moscow, the other in ancient Jerusalem, each brimming with incident and with historical, imaginary, frightful and wonderful characters. Although completed in 1940, The Master and Margarita was not published until 1966 when the first section appeared in the monthly magazine Moskva. Russians everywhere responded enthusiastically to the novel&#39;s artistic and spiritual freedom and it was an immediate and enduring success. This new translation has been made from the complete and unabridged Russian text.</p><p>Surely no stranger work exists in the annals of protest literature than <i>The Master and Margarita</i>. Written during the Soviet crackdown of the 1930s, when Mikhail Bulgakov's works were effectively banned, it wraps its anti-Stalinist message in a complex allegory of good and evil. Or would that be the other way around? The book's chief character is Satan, who appears in the guise of a foreigner and self-proclaimed black magician named Woland. Accompanied by a talking black tomcat and a "translator" wearing a jockey's cap and cracked pince-nez, Woland wreaks havoc throughout literary Moscow. First he predicts that the head of noted editor Berlioz will be cut off; when it is, he appropriates Berlioz's apartment. (A puzzled relative receives the following telegram: "Have just been run over by streetcar at Patriarch's Ponds funeral Friday three afternoon come Berlioz.") Woland and his minions transport one bureaucrat to Yalta, make another one disappear entirely except for his suit, and frighten several others so badly that they end up in a psychiatric hospital. In fact, it seems half of Moscow shows up in the bin, demanding to be placed in a locked cell for protection. <p> Meanwhile, a few doors down in the hospital lives the true object of Woland's visit: the author of an unpublished novel about Pontius Pilate. This Master--as he calls himself--has been driven mad by rejection, broken not only by editors' harsh criticism of his novel but, Bulgakov suggests, by political persecution as well. Yet Pilate's story becomes a kind of parallel narrative, appearing in different forms throughout Bulgakov's novel: as a manuscript read by the Master's indefatigable love, Margarita, as a scene dreamed by the poet--and fellow lunatic--Ivan Homeless, and even as a story told by Woland himself. Since we see this narrative from so many different points of view, who is truly its author? Given that the Master's novel and this one end the same way, are they in fact the same book? These are only a few of the many questions Bulgakov provokes, in a novel that reads like a set of infinitely nested Russian dolls: inside one narrative there is another, and then another, and yet another. His devil is not only entertaining, he is <i>necessary</i>: "What would your good be doing if there were no evil, and what would the earth look like if shadows disappeared from it?"</p><p> Unsurprisingly--in view of its frequent, scarcely disguised references to interrogation and terror--Bulgakov's masterwork was not published until 1967, almost three decades after his death. Yet one wonders if the world was really ready for this book in the late 1930s, if, indeed, we are ready for it now. Shocking, touching, and scathingly funny, it is a novel like no other. Woland may reattach heads or produce 10-ruble notes from the air, but Bulgakov proves the true magician here. <i>The Master and Margarita</i> is a different book each time it is opened. <i>--Mary Park</i></p>The devil, disguised as a magician, descends upon Moscow in the 1930s with his riotous band, which includes a talking cat and an expert assassin. Together they succeed in comically befuddling a population which denies the devil&#39;s existence, even as it is confronted with the diabolic results of a magic act gone wrong. This visit to the capital of world atheism has several aims, one of which concerns the fate of the Master, a writer who has written a novel about Pontius Pilate, and is now in a mental hospital. Margarita, the despairing and daring heroine, becomes a witch in an effort to save the Master, and agrees to become the devil&#39;s hostess at his annual spring ball. By turns acidly satiric, fantastic, and ironically philosophical, this work constantly surprises and entertains, as the action switches back and forth between the Moscow of the 1930s and first-century Jerusalem.</p><h2>PROBLEMS AND SOLUTIONS ON ELECTROMAGNETISM (Major American Universities PH.D.

They remain excellent advice for current students to consider and implement in their own journey into the law. This is no Chamber of Commerce speech of mere platitudes about law practice and the grandeur of the bar. To be sure, Llewellyn believed in law school and legal education, and in dreaming big about a life in the law. But he was&#x2014;famously&#x2014;a realist above all, and this book gets to the nuts and bolts of studying law successfully in traditional legal education. </p> <p>Whether from the enduring nature of his hands-on advice, or from the reality that the first year of law study and its classroom method simply have not changed very much over the years, the book remains, by all accounts, targeted to the way 'thinking like a lawyer' continues in the modern law school.</p> <p>Now in a high-quality new edition from Quid Pro, <i>The Bramble Bush</i> is part of the <i>Legal Legends</i> Series. It features embedded page numbers from the previous, standard print editions&#x2014;for continuity of assignments and referencing.

Cooper explores and demonstrates all aspects of drawing and painting birds. Renowned for his gorgeous and accurate wildlife renderings, Cooper here explains in detail how to create a true impression of a bird's appearance. The author describes his own experiences among birds in the wild, discusses bird anatomy, and lays out the essential principles of realistic painting. He guides both seasoned artists and enthusiastic beginners through all the techniques and processes involved in depicting birds anywhere in the world. </p><p>In the first part of the book, Cooper covers materials, bird anatomy, methods of working from captive birds (in zoos, for example), and methods for working in the field. He places special emphasis on the artist's understanding of the subject and how this knowledge can be transformed into drawings and paintings. The second part of the book deals with watercolors, acrylics, and oil paints, explaining for each medium the step-by-step processes leading from beginning sketches to finished work.</p></p><p><b>William T.

The silence extended for four hundred years, and during that time God was withdrawn from Israel. Throughout this period there were no angelic manifestations, no prophet spoke for Jehovah, and though the Chosen People were so rely pressed, yet were there no Divine interpositions on their behalf. For four centuries God shut His people up to His written Word. Again and again had He promised to send the Messiah, and from Malachi onwards there was a believing remnant who anxiously awaited the appearing of the predicted One. It is at this point that Matthew picks up the thread dropped by the last of the Old Testament prophets. The first purpose of Matthew&#39;s Gospel is to present Christ as the Fulfiller of the promises made to Israel and the prophecies which related to their Messiah. This is why the word &#34;fulfilled&#34; occurs in Matthew fifteen times, and why there are more quotations from the Old Testament in his Gospel than in the remaining three added together.&#34; Arthur Walkington Pink was an English Christian evangelist and Biblical scholar known for his staunchly Calvinist and Puritan-like teachings. Though born to Christian parents, prior to conversion he migrated into a Theosophical society (an occult gnostic group popular in England during that time), and quickly rose in prominence within their ranks. His conversion came from his father&#39;s patient admonitions from Scripture. It was the verse, Proverbs 14:12, &#39;there is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death,&#39; which particularly struck his heart and compelled him to renounce Theosophy and follow Jesus.</p><p>Arthur W. Pink has held various pastorates in the United States. He has been engaged in Bible conference work in the United States, Australia, and other countries and resided in Scotland up until the time of his death, July 15, 1952. Pink was the author of various books and booklets on Bible exposition, as well as the editor and publisher of a Bible study magazine, Studies in the Scriptures.</p><h2>Concepts and categories: Philosophical essays (His Selected writings ; v. 2)</h2><p>Included here are Berlin&#39;s early arguments against logical positivism and later essays which more evidently reflect his life-long interest in political theory, intellectual history and the philosophy of history.</p><p>This collection of eight essays spans the range of Isaiah Berlin's interests, including his role in the disputes of language philosophers in the 1930s, his interest in political philosophy, and his later attention to the history of ideas. In Berlin's preface, he records his decision to abandon philosophy for history in the 1940s, but by his own definition of philosophy, given in the first essay ("The Purpose of Philosophy"), he continued to be a philosopher par excellence, radically questioning the models, or categories, by which human beings understand their world. Berlin sees this as the perennial task of the philosopher (which he recognizes as "agonizing and thankless") and one he takes up in this collection with analyses in chapters such as "Verification" and "Equality." <p> It is doubtful now whether Berlin's view of philosophy would be taken as an exhaustive account of the enterprise, especially with the flourishing in the last 25 years of applied ethics and political philosophy. And it seems reasonable to suppose that philosophy will continue to involve speculative work about the proper ends of human life, as well as logical analysis. Berlin's paradoxical contribution, evident in this collection, was that in committing himself to a life of radical questioning of concepts and categories, he in fact proposed a purpose for life, namely the creation of a society that would not be duped by incoherent and idealistic models of the world. Radical philosophical questioning, that drive for clarity in language and for models of the world that are capable of empirical testing, is not in such circumstances the Sisyphean endeavor it might otherwise appear. <i>--Jeff Petts, Amazon.co.uk</i></p><br> <p>"In a dark century, he showed what a life of the mind should be: skeptical, ironical, dispassionate and free."<b>--Michael Ignatieff</b><br> </p><br></p><h2>A Death in the Family: A Restoration of the Author&#39;s Text (Volume 1) (Collected Works of James Agee)</h2><p>Published in 1957 to wide acclaim, James Agee's <i>A Death in the Family</i> was posthumously awarded the Pulitzer Prize for literature. However, the novel had been so heavily edited by publisher and editor David McDowell that it little resembled the manuscript that James Agee had completed at the time of his death. The inaugural title of the University of Tennessee Press's scholarly edition of The Works of James Agee, this restored text of <i>A Death in the Family</i> is, in many ways, a new novel.<br>&nbsp;<br>This volume provides, for the first time, a modern critical edition of Agee's manuscript, a novel based upon his childhood and his attempts to understand the death of his father. The new introduction is a revealing nightmare rather than an idyllic reverie; the book includes ten and one-third previously omitted chapters, substitutes three finished chapters for erroneously printed drafts, and is divided into forty-five chapters rather than twenty; it is chronological and has no flashback chapters; real names of people and places are used, as are more regional speech patterns; and young Rufus (based on young James), his father, and their deep and caring relationship are far more fully developed. All are changes that showcase the intended autobiographical realism of the novel.<br><br>This comprehensive edition also provides the reader with an introductory essay, a way to read the McDowell edition from it for purposes of comparison, Agee's draft of his memories of his father's death, unfinished letters to his parents, manuscript variants, and textual notes which document each part of the reconstruction.&nbsp; The edition has received the approval of the Committee on Scholarly Editions of the Modern Language Association.<br><br>Wonderfully evocative, this exciting reconstruction of <i>A Death in the Family</i> provides a firmer sense of Agee's achievement as a writer of creative non-fiction and presents his literary genius to a new generation of readers.<br><br>Michael A.

In <em>Baseball's Great Experiment: Jackie Robinson and His Legacy</em>, Tygiel penned a classic work, a landmark book that towers above most writing about the sport. Now he ranges across the last century and a half in an intriguing look at baseball as history, and history as reflected in baseball.<br><br>In <em>Past Time</em>, Tygiel gives us a seat behind home plate, where we catch the ongoing interplay of baseball and American society. We begin in New York in the 1850s, where pre-Civil War nationalism shaped the emergence of a "national pastime." We witness the true birth of modern baseball with the development of its elaborate statistics--the brainchild of English-born reformer, Henry Chadwick. Chadwick, Tygiel writes, created the sport's "historical essence" and even imparted a moral dimension to the game with his concepts of "errors" and "unearned" runs. Tygiel offers equally insightful looks at the role of rags-to-riches player-owners in the formation of the upstart American League and he describes the complex struggle to establish African-American baseball in a segregated world. He also examines baseball during the Great Depression (when Branch Rickey and Larry MacPhail saved the game by perfecting the farm system, night baseball, and radio broadcasts), the ironies of Bobby Thomson's immortal "shot heard 'round the world," the rapid relocation of franchises in the 1950s and 1960s, and the emergence of rotisserie leagues and fantasy camps in the 1980s. <br><br>In <em>Past Time</em>, Jules Tygiel provides baseball history with a difference. Instead of a pitch-by-pitch account of great games, in this groundbreaking book, the field is American history and baseball itself is the star.<br></p><p>In <i>Baseball's Great Experiment: Jackie Robinson and His Legacy</i> and the follow-up <i>Jackie Robinson Reader</i>, Jules Tygiel focused his historian's eye on what was arguably baseball's most stunning single event. Dissecting it from every angle, he followed its consequences through the weft of the national fabric in a pair of consummate, readable, and marvelously entertaining books that painted an arresting portrait of a remarkable man and his remarkable ordeal. In <i>Past Time</i> Tygiel widens his focus to turn his considerable narrative and interpretive skills loose on the broader tapestry of the game itself. The result is a superb collection of essays on American history filtered through the national pastime's lens. "If there is a unifying theme"--and there certainly is--"it is that while the game of baseball itself has changed minimally since its origins, the context and format in which Americans have absorbed and appreciated the game have dramatically shifted."<p> Drawing on his encyclopedic knowledge of the game, Tygiel uses the game as his doorway for entry into--and airing out--several rooms of the American past. Though the nine essays that make up <i>Past Time</i> reflect the game's nine innings and are presented chronologically, they are each entities unto themselves and can be read in any order. Rarely stepping onto the playing field, they avoid the mushiness and rhapsodizing that baseball tends to evoke. Instead, they take provocative looks at the often overlooked--like why statistics hold the game together, and why holding the game together was crucial to an America emerging from the Civil War--and fresh looks at old warhorses like baseball and the Depression era, baseball and civil rights, and baseball and America's post-World War II geographical shift. The final "inning" examines such recent obsessions as rotisserie leagues and fantasy camps, and the chapter on Bobby Thompson's famed home run and how the ways we would experience the game in the early years of the Cold War would change is thoroughly absorbing. But, then, so is the rest of <i>Past Time</i>. It has you wishing for extra "innings." <i>--Jeff Silverman</i></p><br><strong>Jules Tygiel</strong> is Professor of History at San Francisco State University.

Voluptuous immobility is thought to beautify girls' bodies, hasten the onset of puberty, heighten their sexuality and ripen them for marriage. From the time of the loss of their first milk teeth, girls are directed to eat huge bowls of milk and porridge in one of the world's few examples of active female fattening. Based on fieldwork in an Arab village in Niger, <em>Feeding Desire</em> analyses the meanings of women's fatness as constituted by desire, kinship, concepts of health, Islam, and the crucial social need to manage sexuality. By demonstrating how a particular beauty ideal can only be understood within wider social structures and cultural logics, the book also implicitly provides a new way of thinking about the ideal of slimness in late Western capitalism. Offering a reminder that an estimated eighty per cent of the world's societies prefer plump women, this gracefully written book is both a fascinating exploration of the nature of bodily ideals and a highly readable ethnography of a Saharan people.</p><p>Rebecca Popenoe is Visiting Lecturer in Anthropology at Uppsala University in Sweden.

For exponents of high modernism, the essence of each medium lay inherently in its own particular material properties. Accordingly, the import of painting was its &#34;flatness,&#34; as exemplified by the monochrome canvas. But some artists rejected this description as inadequate. Citing the examples of film, television, and video, they understood and articulated the medium as a complex structure of technical supports and layered conventions distinct from physical properties. Here, Rosalind Krauss positions the work of Marcel Broodthaers within this alternative narrative. Referring to the Belgian artist&#39;s films, books, graphic design, and museum &#34;fictions,&#34; she presents Broodthaers as standing at, and thus standing for, the &#34;complex&#34; of the self-differing medium.</p><p>Rosalind Krauss is Meyer Schapiro Professor of Modern Art and Theory at Columbia University.A brilliant new chapter in her continuing investigation of medium specificity. -- <i>Artforum, Carlos Basualdo, December 2000</i></p><h2>Exemplary Stories (Oxford World&#39;s Classics)</h2><p>More popular in their day than Don Quxixote, Cervantes's <em>Exemplary Stories</em> (1613) surprise, challenge and delight.

Two men, inseparable in their youth, meet for the first time in forty-one years. They have spent their lives waiting for this moment. Four decades earlier a murky, traumatic event - something to do with a betrayal, and a woman - led to their sudden separation. Now, as their lives draw to a close, the devastating truth about that moment will be revealed. EMBERS is a masterpiece - an unforgettable story of passion, fidelity, truth and deception.</p><p>In S�ndor M�rai's <i>Embers</i>, two old men, once the best of friends, meet after a 41-year break in their relationship. They dine together, taking the same places at the table that they had assumed on the last meal they shared, then sit beside each other in front of a dying fire, one of them nearly silent, the other one, his host, slowly and deliberately tracing the course of their dead friendship. This sensitive, long-considered elaboration of one man's lifelong grievance is as gripping as any adventure story and explains why M�rai's forgotten 1942 masterpiece is being compared with the work of Thomas Mann. In some ways, M�rai's work is more modern than Mann's. His brevity, simplicity, and succinct, unadorned lyricism may call to mind Latin American novelists like Gabriel Garc�a M�rquez, or even Italo Calvino. It is the tone of magical realism, although M�rai's work is only magical in the sense that he completely engages his reader, spinning a web of words as his wounded central character describes his betrayal and abandonment at the hands of his closest friend. Even the setting, an old castle, evokes dark fairy tales. <p> The story of the rediscovery of <i>Embers</i> is as fascinating as the novel itself. A celebrated Hungarian novelist of the 1930s, M�rai survived the war but was persecuted by the Communists after they came to power. His books were suppressed, even destroyed, and he was forced to flee his country in 1948. He died in San Diego in 1989, one year before the neglected <i>Embers</i> was finally reprinted in his native land. This reprint was discovered by the Italian writer and publisher Roberto Calasso, and the subsequent editions have become international bestsellers. All of M�rai's novels are now slated for American publication. <i>--Regina Marler</i></p>"Thanks to this first English translation of <i>Embers</i>, our ever-shrinking world of culture seems a little bigger....The reviewer must be discreet because any description of the novel's central event will destroy the spell that every reader is entitled to in reading [it]. Let it be said that in every way the novel is satisfying. There are no loose ends, no cheap avoidances, no dangling possibilites for a sequel.... the statues in the famous metaphorical garden of T.S. Eliot's literary tradition will have to be rearranged to make room for this powerful work."<br>-Tom McGonigle, <i> Los Angeles Times</i><br><br><b><br></b>"<b>The first English translation of a brooding, densely atmospheric, forgotten 1942 novel whose eminent Hungarian expatriate author (b. 1900) committed suicide, while living in the US, in his 89th year. . . . Mesmerizing. . . . A major rediscovery, arguably comparable to those of Bruno Schulz, Leo Perutz, and Joseph Roth. A small, beautifully fashioned masterpiece."</b><br>-<i>-Kirkus Reviews </i>(starred review)<br><br>"With the triumph of a two hundred page novel, twentieth-century literature--which we thought was finally dead and buried--has received the posthumous gift of a new master whom in the future we will rank with Joseph Roth, Stefan Zweig, Robert Musil and even our other lost demigods, Thomas Mann and Franz Kafka. His name is S�ndor M�rai."<br>-<i>Die Zeit</i><br><br>"M�rai is in the almost unique position of having attained posthumous best-sellerdom (in country after country) because he distills plot and description to a magic essence of atmosphere, empathy and narrative tension that no European writer has achieved since Joseph Roth."<br>-<i>Berthier Zeitung</i><br><br>"A novel that pares all superfluous detail away from plot and character to achieve maximum tension. Hemingway goes Habsburg!"<br>-<i>Stadtzeitung Wien</i><br><br>"A literary master lays bare the essentials---what is truth, what are the questions we ask, what is the meaning of life itself---and lets them explode into action. His philosophy is profound but hardly leaves a footprint and is virtuoso in its clear-sighted precision. This novel is a literary rediscovery of the first rank."<br>-<i>Hamburger Abendblatt</i><br><br>"This major European novelist not only anatomizes--brilliantly--one triangular relationship from the old Austro-Hungarian Empire, he also captures the pandemonium of all human relationships: the smoldering embers of our feelings, of lust, love, revenge and hate. It is wonderful, and a masterpiece." <br>- <i>Der Spiegel</i></p><h2>The Great Evil: Christianity, the Bible, and the Native American Genocide</h2><p>In this account of the history between Indigenous Peoples and the United States government, readers will learn the role of the bible played in the perpetration of genocide, massive land theft, and the religious suppression and criminalization of Native ceremonies and spirituality. Chris Mato Nunpa, a Dakota man, discusses this dishonorable and darker side of American history that is rarely studied, if at all. Out of a number of rationales used to justify the killing of Native Peoples and theft their lands, the author will discuss a biblical rationale, including the &#x201c;chosen people&#x201d; idea, the &#x201c;promised land&#x201d; notion, and the genocidal commands of the Old Testament God. Mato Nunpa&#x2019;s experience with fundamentalist and evangelical missionaries when he was growing up, his studies in Indigenous Nations history at the University of Minnesota, and his affiliation with the International Association of Genocide Scholars (IAGS) were three important factors in his motivation for writing this book.</p><p><b>Chris Mato Nunpa, Ph.D</b> is&nbsp;a former Associate Professor of Indigenous Nations &amp; Dakota Studies at Southwest Minnesota State University.

"Of all the books published so far in this century," Clifton Fadiman once said, "the one most assured of being read a hundred years from now is <em>A Study of History</em>." <em>The Los Angeles Times</em> called it "a veritable masterpiece of erudition and one of the most suggestive, stimulating and inspiring studies of this age."<br> In <em>The Study</em>, Toynbee revolutionized the writing of history. By encompassing virtually all civilizations--the Egyptian, the Sumeric, the Mayan, the Iranian, the Japanese, the Hellenic, and the West, to name only a few--within the scope of his monumental work, he achieved the first all-embracing synthesis of world history. Before Toynbee, world histories were histories of the West, and only specialists wrote Babylonian, Arabian, or Aztec history. But Toynbee's scheme includes all nations and, more remarkably, by his emphasis on general patterns--on the genesis, growth and breakdown of civilizations--he was able to give a shape to this incredibly diverse material, making it comprehendable to the general reader.<br> And Somervell's Abridgement is also a masterpiece--a masterpiece of condensation. In only two volumes, he has captured the method, atmosphere, texture, and, in most instances, the very words of the original. By leaving out most of Toynbee's illustrations, digressions, and asides (some of which were quite lengthy indeed), Somervell has actually clarified the argument of the book. The reaction to his Abridgement, when the first volume appeared in 1947, was exceptional: it was an immediate success in America, and exerpts and articles on it appeared in <em>The Atlantic Monthly</em>, <em>Life</em>, <em>The New York</em> <em>Times Book sums it Review</em>, <em>Newsweek</em>, and <em>Time</em>. The review in <em>The Nation</em> perhaps up best: "If [you] have time for only one book during this year--and the next and the next--Somervell's Abridgement...should be that book."</p><p>Of Somervell&#39;s work, Toynbee wrote, &#39;The reader now has at his command a uniform abridgement of the whole book, made by a clear mind that has not only mastered the contents but has entered into the writer&#39;s outlook and purpose.&#39;<br><em>About the Authors</em>:<br> The late <strong>Arnold Toynbee</strong> was Director of Studies at the Royal Institute of International Affairs, Research Professor of International History at the University of London, and author of numerous books.<br> The late <strong>D.C.

We have aimed to make our account simple enough that these students can learn it and complete enough that they won't have to learn it again. </p> <p> The most visible changes in this edition are the 274 new supplementary exercises and the new chapters on probability and on algebraic structures. The supplementary exercises, which have complete answers in the back of the book, ask more than 700 separate questions. Together with the many end-of-section exercises and the examples throughout the text, these exercises let students practice using the material they are studying. </p> <p> One of our main goals is the development of mathematical maturity. Our presentation starts with an intuitive approach that becomes more and more rigorous as the students' appreciation for proofs and their skill at building them increase. </p> <p> Our account is careful but informal. As we go along, we illustrate the way mathematicians attack problems, and we show the power of an abstract approach. We and our colleagues at Oregon have used this material successfully for many years to teach students who have a standard precalculus background, and we have found that by the end of two quarters they are ready for upperclass work in both computer science and mathematics. The math majors have been introduced to the mathematics culture, and the computer science students have been equipped to look at their subject from both mathematical and operational perspectives. </p> <p> Every effort has been made to avoid duplicating the content of mainstream computer science courses, but we are aware that most of our readers will be coming in contact with some of the same material in their other classes, and we have tried to provide them with a clear, <i>mathematical</i> view of it. An example of our approach can be seen first in Chapter 4, where we give a careful account of while loops. We base our discussion of mathematical induction on these loops, and also, in Chapter 4 and subsequently, show how to use them to design and verify a number of algorithms. We have deliberately stopped short of looking at implementation details for our algorithms, but we have provided most of them with time complexity analyses. We hope in this way to develop in the reader the habit of automatically considering the running time of any algorithm. In, addition, our analyses illustrate the use of some of the basic tools we have been developing for estimating efficiency. </p> <p> The overall outline of the book is essentially that of the fourth edition, with the addition of two new chapters and a large number of supplementary exercises. The first four chapters contain what we regard as the core material of any serious discrete mathematics course. These topics can readily be covered in a quarter. A semester course can add combinatorics and some probability or can pick up graphs, trees, and recursive algorithms. </p> <p> We have retained some of the special features of previous editions, such as the development of mathematical induction from a study of while loop invariants, but we have also looked for opportunities to improve the presentation, sometimes by changing notation. We have gone through the book section by section looking for ways to provide more motivation, with the result that many sections now begin where they used to end, in the sense that the punch lines now appear first as questions or goals that get resolved by the end of the section. </p> <p> We have added another "Office Hours" section at the end of Chapter 1, this one emphasizing the importance of learning definitions and notation. These sections, which we introduced in the fourth edition, allow us to step back a bit from our role as text authors to address the kinds of questions that our own students have Asked. They give us a chance to suggest how to study the material and focus on what's important. You may want to reinforce our words, or you may want to take issue with them when you talk with your own students. In any case, the Office Hours provide an alternative channel for us to talk with our readers without being formal, and perhaps they will help your students open up with their own questions in class or in the office. </p> <p> We have always believed that students at this level learn best from examples, so we have added examples to the large number already present and have revised others, all to encourage students to read the book. Our examples are designed to accompany and illustrate the mathematical ideas as we develop them. They let the instructor spend time on selected topics in class and assign reading to fill out the presentation. Operating in this way, we have found that we can normally cover a section a day in class. The instructor's manual, available from Prentice Hall, indicates which sections might take longer and contains a number of suggestions for emphasis and pedagogy, as well as complete answers to all end-of-section exercises. </p> <p> The end-of-chapter supplementary questions, which are a new feature of this edition, are designed to give students practice at thinking about the material. We see these exercises as representative of the sorts of questions students should be able to answer after studying a chapter. We have deliberately not arranged them in order of difficulty, and we have deliberately also not keyed them to sections&#x2014;indeed, many of the exercises bring together material from several sections. To see what we mean, look at the supplementary exercises for Chapter 5, on combinatorics, where we have included an especially large number of problems, many of which have a variety of essentially different parts. A few of the supplementary questions, such as the ones in Chapter 12 on algorithms to solve the Chinese Remainder and Polynomial Interpolation problems, also extend the text account in directions that would have interrupted the flow of ideas if included in the text itself. Some of the questions are very easy and some are harder, but none of them are meant to be unusually difficult. In any case, we have provided complete answers to all of them, not just the odd-numbered ones, in the back of the book, where students can use them to check their understanding and to review for exams. </p> <p> The new chapters on probability and algebraic structures respond to requests from current and past users who were disappointed that we had dropped these topics in going from the third edition to the fourth. Since those were two of our favorite chapters, we were happy to reinstate them and we have taken this opportunity to completely revise each of them. In Chapter 9 we now work in the setting of discrete probability, with only tantalizing, brief allusions to continuous probability, most notably in the transition to normal distributions from binomial distributions. The material on semigroups, rings, and fields in Chapter 12 is not changed much from the account in the third edition, but the discussion of groups is dramatically different. The emphasis is still on how groups act on sets, but in the context of solving some intriguing combinatoric problems we can develop basic abstract ideas of permutation group theory without getting bogged down in the details of cycle notation. As another response to reader feedback, we have moved the section on matrix multiplication from Chapter 3 to Chapter 11, which is the first place we need it. </p> <p> Naturally, we think this edition is a substantial improvement and worth all of the effort it has taken. We hope you will agree. We welcome any comments and of course especially welcome reports of errors or misprints that we can correct in subsequent printings. </p> <p><b>Supplements</b></p> <p> The Instructor's Resource Manual, which course instructors may obtain gratis from Prentice Hall, contains complete answers to all exercises in the text. In addition, Prentice Hall publishes inexpensive student workbooks of practice problems on discrete mathematics, with full solutions to all exercises. The Prentice Hall Companion Web site for this text contains information about such materials. </p></p><h2>Plain English for Lawyers</h2><p>Carolina Academic Press will publish the fifth edition of Richard Wydick&#x2019;s Plain English for Lawyers in time for use in the fall of 2005. Wydick&#x2019;s little book has been a favorite of law students, legal writing teachers, lawyers, and judges for over 25 years.Last January, the Legal Writing Institute gave Wydick its Golden Pen Award for having written Plain English for Lawyers. The Legal Writing Institute is a non-profit organization that provides a forum for discussion and scholarship about legal writing, analysis, and research. The Institute has over 1,300 members representing all of the ABA-accredited law schools in the United States. Its membership also includes law teachers from other nations, English teachers, and practicing lawyers.The LWI award states: &#x201c;Plain English for Lawyers . . . has become a classic. Perhaps no single work has done more to improve the writing of lawyers and law students and to promote the modern trend toward a clear, plain style of legal writing.&#x201d; In 2003 Wydick retired after 32 years on the law faculty of the University of California, Davis. But he still teaches his favorite course &#x2014; a seminar in advanced legal writing for third-year law students. For the past eight summers he has also lectured at the International Legislative Drafting Institute presented in New Orleans by the Public Law Center, a joint venture of Tulane and Loyola law schools. There the audience consists of lawyers and non-lawyers from abroad who earn their living drafting legislation in many different languages. &#x201c;Teaching at the Institute,&#x201d; Wydick says, &#x201c;is a precious opportunity to learn how much we English-users have in common with people who write laws in other languages.&#x201d; How will the fifth edition of Plain English for Lawyers differ from its predecessors? Wydick promises that it will remain a little book, small enough and palatable enough not to intimidate over-loaded law students. &#x201c;Most of the text will remain the same,&#x201d; Wydick says, &#x201c;but in the past seven years I&#x2019;ve learned some new things about writing in English, and I want to share that with the readers.&#x201d; In addition, the exercises at the end of the chapters will be different (a welcome change for long-time teachers who are tired of the old ones). Finally, the teacher&#x2019;s manual will include additional exercises that teachers can give to students who want or need extra practice.</p><p>Richard C.

Chesterton's favorite pub in Oxford; and from the grave of a modern martyr in Warsaw to the Sistine Chapel. <br>Weaving together insights from history, literature, theology, and music, Weigel illuminates the beliefs that give Catholicism its distinctive texture and explores the theological importance of grace, prayer, vocation, sin and forgiveness, suffering, and -- most importantly -- love. To a world that sometimes seems closed and claustrophobic, he suggests, Christian humanism offers a world with windows and doors -- and a skylight.</p><p><b>George Weigel</b> is distinguished senior fellow of Washington's Ethics and Public Policy Center and one of America's leading public intellectuals. The first volume of his biography of Pope John Paul II, <i>Witness to Hope</i>, was a <i>New York Times </i>bestseller, and his writing appears regularly in a variety of publications, including the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>. He lives in North Bethesda, Maryland.In this spiritual memoir-cum-travelogue, Weigel writes with the same beauty and clarity that characterized his biography of Pope John Paul II, Witness to Hope, merging reportage with personal insights about Catholicism. He takes readers on a journey from Maryland to Europe and Israel, visiting sites that are whimsical (G.K. Chesterton&#x2019;s favorite pub) as well as those that are renowned as holy (the Dormition Abbey in Jerusalem, St. Peter&#x2019;s Cathedral in Rome). Writing in a conversational, epistolary form aimed at young Catholics, Weigel offers a book that simultaneously is, and is not, your grandmother&#x2019;s catechism: he affirms the core doctrines of the Church, but he does so in a way that is refreshingly contemporary and&#x2014;because of his emphasis on Church sites around the world&#x2014;catholic as well as Catholic. Weigel opens the book with an entertaining description of his childhood in the Catholic stronghold of Baltimore, and invites young readers to entertain the idea that Catholicism is not just a creed but an "optic," a rooted way of viewing the world. In the rest of the book, he introduces that world and offers them new lenses with which to understand it. This book is simply first-rate. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Some of the objects represent turn-of-the-century designs of the Vienna Secession, Art Nouveau and the Arts and Crafts movement; others are Bauhaus and de Stijl explorations; still others show Charles and Ray Eames and other American designers of the second half of the twentieth century; representations of the Italian design revolutions; and contemporary manifestations of familiar genres using radical new materials and techniques of manufacture. The book's 360 color plates not only reveal the range of aesthetic viewpoints in design since the late nineteenth century but together trace the historical development of the Museum's celebrated design collection. In the introductory essay, Paola Antonelli, Curator, Department of Architecture and Design at The Museum of Modern Art, explores the history of modern design as well as the story of the museum's collection and its influence on the history of modern and contemporary design itself.</p><p></p><h2>The Blackwell Companion to Christian Ethics</h2><p><i>The Blackwell Companion to Christian Ethics</i> presents a comprehensive and systematic exposition of Christian ethics, seen through the lens of Christian worship. <br> <ul> <li>An innovative exposition of Christian ethics, seen through the lens of Christian worship</li> <li>Challenges conventional approaches to the subject</li> <li>Restores a sense of the integral connection between Christian ethics and theology</li> <li>Stanley Hauerwas is one of the most influential figures in Christian ethics around the world</li> <li>Embraces contributors from the Roman Catholic, Anglican, Methodist, Presbyterian, Mennonite and Pentecostal traditions</li> <li>Designed to be accessible to introductory students</li> <li>Will have a major impact on the discipline of Christian ethics</li> </ul></p><p>The Blackwell Companion to Christian Ethics presents an innovative exposition of Christian ethics, seen through the lens of Christian worship. Editors Stanley Hauerwas and Samuel Wells challenge conventional approaches to the subject, contending that it is Christian worship that shapes the moral life of Christians. In this way, they restore a sense of the integral connection between Christian ethics and theology. The structure of the volume reflects this fresh approach to the discipline, following the practices of the Eucharist in a liturgical sequence from the &#34;Gathering&#34; through to the &#34;Dismissal&#34;. The Companion is ecumenical in spirit and embraces contributions from leading commentators within the Roman Catholic, Anglican, Methodist, Presbyterian, Mennonite, and Pentecostal traditions. Designed to be accessible to introductory students, it will have a major impact on the study of Christian ethics.<b>Stanley Hauerwas</b> is Gilbert T. Rowe Professor of Theological Ethics at the Divinity School, Duke University, North Carolina. He is regarded as a, if not the, leading figure in Christian ethics. His book, <i>A Community of Character: Toward a Constructive Christian Social Ethic</i>, was selected as one of the 100 most important books on religion of the twentieth century. He is one of the most brilliant and original thinkers of his generation. He has written numerous books including: <i>The Peaceable Kingdom</i> (1983), <i>A Community of Character</i> (1981), <i>Resident Aliens</i> (1989), <i>Christians Among the Virtues</i> (1997), <i>Wilderness Wanderings: Probing Twentieth Century Theology</i> (1997), <i>Sanctify Them in the Truth</i> (1998), and <i>With the Grain of the Universe: the Church&#x2019;s Witness and Natural Theology</i> (2001). <br> <p><b>Samuel Wells</b> is Priest-in-Charge of St Mark's, Newnham, Cambridge, and a writer in theological ethics.

Editors Erich Goode and D. Angus Vail tunnel to the core of the subject by emphasizing a set of central lessons, offering edgy, pedagogically dramatic illustrations of principles that are contained in no other collection of readings.

No document provides a more complete record of the deliberations in Philadelphia or depicts the Convention&#x2019;s charismatic figures, crushing disappointments, and miraculous triumphs with such narrative force. But how reliable is this account?</p><p>In an unprecedented investigation that draws on digital technologies and traditional textual analysis to trace Madison&#x2019;s composition, Mary Sarah Bilder reveals that Madison revised the Notes to a far greater extent than previously recognized. The Notes began as a diary of the Convention&#x2019;s proceedings. Madison abandoned the project at a critical juncture, however, and left the Notes incomplete. He did not return to finish them until several years later, largely for Thomas Jefferson. By then, Madison&#x2019;s views were influenced by the new government&#x2019;s challenges and Jefferson&#x2019;s political ideas. Madison&#x2019;s evolving vision of republican government, his Virginia allegiances, his openness to constitutional protection for slavery, his fascination with the finer points of political jockeying, and his depictions of Alexander Hamilton and Charles Pinckney shifted during the writing and rewriting of his account. When the Notes were finally published in 1840, the layers of revision were invisible.</p><p>Madison&#x2019;s version of events quickly assumed an aura of objectivity, and the Notes molded the narrative of the Constitution. <i>Madison&#x2019;s Hand </i>offers readers a biography of a document that, over two centuries, developed a life and character all its own.</p></p><p>Mary Sarah Bilder is Founders Professor of Law and Michael and Helen Lee Distinguished Scholar, Boston College Law School.[A] superb study of the Constitutional Convention as selectively reflected in Madison&#x2019;s voluminous notes on it...Scholars have been aware that Madison made revisions in the <i>Notes</i> but have not intensively explored them.

(Robert K. Landers <i>Wall Street Journal</i>)<br><br>The reliability of <i>Madison&#x2019;s Notes</i> as a credible contemporaneous record of what really transpired in Philadelphia is being challenged as never before in an important new book... Bilder, using forensic techniques to date the changes [James Madison] made and historical research to describe what was happening politically when he made them, has made sense of the revisions, which began right after the convention and continued up until his death. And many of them amount to what we would now call &#x2018;spin.&#x2019; (Fred Barbash <i>Washington Post</i>)<br><br>A major contribution to our understanding of the Constitutional Convention. (Jack N. Rakove, author of <i>The Annotated U.S. Constitution and Declaration of Independence</i>)<br><br>Bilder has written the definitive study of one of the most influential texts in American constitutional history. She demonstrates that Madison&#x2019;s notes on the Philadelphia Convention were never intended to preserve an impartial transcript of debates for posterity. They were designed, rather, to serve the various purposes of their author, which changed dramatically over the decades. The text assumed its final form only when a much older Madison felt it necessary to project the ideological allegiances of Jeffersonian Republicanism backward onto the Convention. We will never read this seminal document the same way again. (Eric Nelson, author of <i>The Royalist Revolution</i>)<br><br>In this eye-opening book, Bilder employs advanced research techniques to revise and correct our understanding of the written record of the Constitutional Convention. Along the way, she offers original and sometimes surprising new interpretations of many of the events and controversies that gave rise to our Constitution. Anyone who wants to understand the Constitution must take this book into account. (Michael McConnell, co-author of <i>The Constitution of the United States</i>)<br><br>Every historian who has ever written about the Constitutional Convention has used James Madison&#x2019;s &#x2018;Notes&#x2019; as a fundamental primary source. And although nearly all are aware of the fact that Madison revised his notes over time, no one has ever attempted a systematic study of the nature of those revisions or of the significant ways in which those changes might have altered our understanding of the Convention. <i>Madison&#x2019;s Hand </i>is an exceptionally important piece of work that will have a profound impact on all future work on the Constitutional Convention. (Richard Beeman, author of <i>Our Lives, Our Fortunes and Our Sacred Honor</i>)<br><br>For nearly two centuries, Madison&#x2019;s &#x2018;Notes&#x2019; have been regarded as secular scripture: an inerrant, authoritative, and complete account of the drafting of the Constitution. Bilder reveals them instead as an intricate palimpsest, altered and expanded repeatedly between 1787 and Madison&#x2019;s death in 1836&#x2015;with each change subtly reflecting the passions of the day rather than a quest for &#x2018;original understanding.&#x2019; What emerges from this important book is a more human Madison, a more complex framing story, a new light on the struggles of the early Republic, and a deeper regard for the complexities and fascinations of American constitutional history. (Garrett Epps, author of <i>American Epic: Reading the U.S. Constitution</i>)<br><br>A kind of biography of Madison&#x2019;s notes...Bilder has done the first intensive study of the actual paper on which Madison&#x2019;s notes are written, Madison&#x2019;s handwriting in different parts of the notes, and other aspects of the actual physical artifacts.

The book also traces the rise of creationism and the history of fundamentalism in America.</p><p>This compelling book reveals that the Creation Museum is a remarkably complex phenomenon, at once a "natural history" museum at odds with contemporary science, an extended brief for the Bible as the literally true and errorless word of God, and a powerful and unflinching argument on behalf of the Christian right.</p></p><p><p>What does the popularity of the Creation Museum tell us about the appeal of the Christian right?</p><p><b>Susan L.

Contributors include such jazz insiders as Bill Crow, Samuel A. Floyd Jr., Ted Gioia, Gene Lees, Dan Morgenstern, Gunther Schuller, Richard M. Sudhalter, and Patricia Willard. Both a reference book and an engaging read, the Companion surveys the evolution of jazz from its roots in Africa and Europe until the present. Along the way, each distinctive style and period is profiled by an expert in the field. Whether your preference is ragtime, the blues, bebop, or fusion, you will find the chief characteristics and memorable performances illuminated here with a thoroughness found in no other single-volume jazz reference.<br><br><em>The Oxford Companion to Jazz</em> features individual biographies of the most memorable characters of this relatively young art form. Sidney Bechet, King Oliver, Jelly Roll Morton, Louis Armstrong, Bix Beiderbecke, Bessie Smith, Duke Ellington, Coleman Hawkins, Lester Young, Charlie Parker, Miles Davis, Thelonious Monk, Charles Mingus, John Coltrane, and the divas of jazz song--Ella Fitzgerald, Billie Holiday, and Sarah Vaughan--come to life in thoughtful considerations of their influences, often turbulent personal lives, and signature styles. In addition, this book looks at the impact of jazz on American culture-in literature, film, television, and dance-and explores the essential instruments of jazz and their most memorable players.<br><br><em>The Oxford Companion to Jazz</em> will provide a quick reference source as well as a dynamic and broad overview for all lovers of jazz, from novices to aficionados.<br></p><p><br><strong>Bill Kirchner</strong> is a composer-arranger, saxophonist, jazz historian, record and radio producer, educator, and leader of the Bill Kirchner Nonet. He has won both Grammy and NAIRD Indie awards, and he teaches jazz composition and jazz history at the New School University, the Manhattan School of Music, and New Jersey City University.<br>This new collection of 60 essays surveys the entire history of jazz and purports to contain "a thoroughness found in no other single jazz reference." The essays, written by 59 current jazz performers, writers, and scholars, are much longer than the typical Oxford Companion entry. The average length is 13 pages, although the range is anywhere from 7 to 22 pages. There is one black-and-white photograph per article. The essays provide overviews of different styles and periods. Other topics include the roots of jazz, biographies of performers, examinations of individual jazz instruments, an analysis of the impact of jazz on American culture, and a discussion of jazz outside the U.S. Arrangement is loosely chronological.<p>Does this volume rival the 1,358-page <i>New Grove Dictionary of Jazz</i> (1988) for the title of "most comprehensive dictionary of jazz ever published"? Possibly. Although the <i>New Grove Dictionary of Jazz</i> is arguably more reference-friendly because of its alphabetical arrangement and <i>see also</i> references, the Oxford book has an excellent index. However, because of the essay format, it is sometimes difficult to find information on a specific performer or term. For this reason, some libraries may wish to consider putting this volume in the circulating rather than in the reference collection.</p><p>The scope of the <i>New Grove Dictionary of Jazz</i> and the <i>Oxford Compan</i>ion to Jazz is similar, although Grove offers unique, unparalleled coverage of jazz nightclubs, festivals, and libraries and archives with significant jazz collections. Unlike Grove, which provides bibliographies and selected recordings at the end of individual entries, Oxford only offers a selected bibliography at the back of the book and an "Index of Songs and Recordings" to facilitate finding where a song is discussed in an essay.</p><p>Though Grove was reprinted in 1994, it was not updated. The Oxford book includes a greater number of recent jazz artists. In an informal search for 27 current jazz artists, 50 percent of them were mentioned in Oxford, while only 25 percent were found in Grove. For example, Grove appears to exclude drummers Joey Baron and Dennis Chambers, trumpeter Dave Douglas, and more-mainstream musicians like Joshua Redman and Jo Lovano, all of whom are mentioned in Oxford. Some of the current artists also appear in another Oxford publication, <i>Biographical Encyclopedia of Jazz</i> (1999).</p><p>Libraries with a jazz collection will find this new volume a welcome addition, whether its purpose is to act as a reference resource or provide insightful stack reading. According to Kirchner, the intended audience is everyone, from novices to seasoned jazz aficionados; the book does indeed have a wide range of appeal. Some of the essays are downright scholarly, while others are less erudite in tone (though not in content). Recommended for all university, college, and public libraries with patrons interested in jazz. <i>RBB</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Written in the form of a dialogue, and revised and expanded from a 2016 conversation between the two philosophers at the Universit�t der K�nste Berlin, the book offers not only Badiou's and Nancy's reinterpretations of German philosophers and philosophical concepts, but also an accessible introduction to the greatest thinkers of German philosophy. Badiou and Nancy discuss and debate such topics as the legacies of Kant, Hegel, and Marx, as well as Nietzsche, Adorno, Fichte, Schelling, and the unavoidable problem of Heidegger and Nazism. The dialogue is contentious, friendly, and often quotable, with strong&#x2015;at times passionate&#x2015;positions taken by both Badiou and Nancy, who find themselves disagreeing over Kant, for example, and in unexpected agreement on Marx, for another.</p><p>What does it mean, then, to conduct a dialogue on German philosophy from a French perspective? As volume editor Jan V�lker observes, &#x201c;German philosophy&#x201d; and &#x201c;French philosophy&#x201d; describe complex constellations that, despite the reference to nation-states and languages, above all encompass shared concepts and problems&#x2015;although these take a range of forms. Perhaps they can reveal their essential import only in translation.</p></p><p>Alain Badiou is a French philosopher. He has published a number of major philosophical works, including <i>The Immanence of Truths</i>, the final installment of his<i> Being and Event</i> trilogy, released in French in 2018.</p><h2>Algebraic Codes for Data Transmission</h2><p>Error-correcting codes play a fundamental role in modern communications and data-storage systems. This volume provides an accessible introduction to the basic elements of algebraic codes and discusses their use in a variety of applications. The author describes a range of important coding techniques, including Reed-Solomon codes, BCH codes, trellis codes, and turbocodes. Throughout the book, mathematical theory is illustrated by reference to many practical examples. The book is written for graduate students of electrical and computer engineering and practicing engineers whose work involves communications or signal processing.</p><p>Professor Richard E.

Yet many people are surprisingly unconcerned about environmental issues, treating them as the province of special interest groups. Seeking to understand how our appreciation for the beauty of nature and our indifference to its destruction can coexist in us, Shierry Weber Nicholsen explores dimensions of our emotional experience with the natural world that are so deep and painful that they often remain unspoken. </p><p><i>The Love of Nature and the End of the World</i> is a gathering of meditations and collages. Its evocations of our emotional attachment to the natural world and the emotional impact of environmental deterioration are meant to encourage individual and collective reflection on a difficult dilemma. Nicholsen draws on work in environmental philosophy and ecopsychology; the writings of psychoanalytic thinkers such as Wilfred Bion, Donald Meltzer, and D. W. Winnicott; and ideas from Buddhist and Sufi traditions. She shows how our emotional responses to the vulnerabilities of the natural world range from intense caring and compassion, through grief and outrage, to diffuse depression. Individual chapters focus on silence and the process whereby we move from the unspoken to the spoken, the love of nature, the "perceptual reciprocity" with the natural world to which we might mature, beauty in the human and natural realms, the psychological impact of the destruction of the natural world, and reflections on the future.</p></p><p>Shierry Weber Nicholsen teaches environmental philosophy and psychology in Antioch University Seattle&#39;s M.A. Program on Environment and Community and is a psychoanalytic psychotherapist in private practice in Seattle. She has translated several works by Theodor Adorno and J�rgen Habermas.<p>In a time of catastrophe it is rare and important to open a book that speaks so profoundly to the problem of human destructiveness without losing sight of the equally human capacity for reparation. <i>The Love of Nature and the End of the World </i> is such a book. Remarkably lucid but never facile, it opens our minds to the overwhelming question of the fate of the earth while offering an intense awareness of what it means be overwhelmed and to suffer trauma. Nicholsen's writing, at once erudite and simple, weaves so effortlessly between psychoanalysis and social thought that we can hardly believe they were ever separate and often inaccessible modes of thinking.</p>&#x2015;<b>Jessica Benjamin</b>, psychoanalyst, author of <i>The Bonds of Love</i> and <i>Shadow of the Other</i></p><h2>Just so stories for little children (Facsimile classics series)</h2><p>Twelve stories which tell how many things came to be, such as the alphabet, camel&#39;s hump, leopard&#39;s spots, and rhinoceros&#39; skin.</p><p>How did the camel get his hump? Why won&#39;t cats do as they are told? Who invented reading and writing? How did an inquisitive little elephant change the lives of elephants everywhere? Kipling&#39;s imagined answers to such questions draw on the beast fables he heard as a child in India, as well as on folk games with language, exploring the relationships between thought, speech, and the written word. He also celebrates his own joy in fatherhood. The tales were told to his own and his friends&#39; children over many years before he wrote them down, adding poems and his own illustrations. They invite older and younger readers to share a magical experience, each contributing to the other&#39;s pleasure, but each can also enjoy them alone, as more jokes, subtexts, and exotic references emerge with every reading. This fully illustrated edition includes two extra stories and Kipling&#39;s own explanation of the title.Kipling&#39;s own drawings, with their long, funny captions, illustrate his hilarious explanations of How the Camel Got His Hump, How the Rhinoceros Got His Skin, How the Armadillo Happened, and other animal How&#39;s.

Drawing on an in-depth locality study of religion and spirituality in the English town of Kendal, Cumbria, this book addresses the most pressing question in the study of religion today: are new forms of spirituality overtaking traditional forms of religion, particularly Christianity? By combining pioneering findings from Kendal with existing evidence from the USA and Europe, this book shows that there is a good deal to support the claim that a spiritual revolution is well underway in the UK and arguably even further advanced in the USA. In explaining this development, the volume offers a new theoretical approach to the study of contemporary religion which can help make sense of both secularization and sacralization, and which leads to some startling predictions about the future of religion and spirituality in the west.Are we living through a &#x2018;spiritual revolution&#x2019; in which traditional forms of religion are giving way to new forms of spirituality? Are yoga, reiki and other forms of holistic practice set to become more popular than churchgoing? <br> <p><br> </p> <p>This book addresses these questions by presenting findings from a major research project designed to chart the state of religion and spirituality today. Though it finds little to support more extreme claims of change, it discovers that spiritualities which engage with the depths of personal experience are faring far better than religions that demand conformity to higher truth. These developments are explained by drawing attention to the significance of a &#x2018;subjective turn&#x2019; in the wider culture &#x2013; whereby conformity to external obligations becomes less important than sensitivity to inner life and wellbeing.</p></p><h2>Ufo&#39;s in the New Age: Extraterrestrial Messages and the Truth of Scripture</h2><p>Here is a fascinating summary of the history and trends of UFOlogy by cult expert and award-winning journalist Bill Alnot.

Now, great power competition is back and the liberal order is in jeopardy. Russia and China are increasingly revisionist in their regions. The Middle East appears to be unraveling. And many Americans question why the United States ought to lead. What will great power competition look like in the decades ahead? Will the liberal world order survive? What impact will geopolitics have on globalization? And, what strategy should the United States pursue to succeed in an increasingly competitive world?

Upton Sinclair&#x2019;s <i>The Jungle</i> portrays the hardships of the immigrant working class in a way that changed literature and history. The story begins with Lithuanian immigrant Jurgis Rudkus, who takes a job at Brown&#x2019;s slaughterhouse to try to earn enough money to stay afloat. His life becomes a constant struggle&#x2014;he, his young wife, Ona, and the rest of his family eventually falling victim to a slew of unfortunate circumstances including exploitation, abuse, and for some even death.<br><br>From unsanitary and unsafe working conditions to poverty wages, the novel revealed to the American public the struggles immigrants encountered in Chicago&#x2019;s meatpacking industry. Sinclair, a muckraking journalist, penned the bestselling narrative in an attempt to expose the evils of capitalism, and bring to light the extreme adversity these people faced not just in Chicago, but in industrialized cities across the country. By detailing numerous health violations in these workplaces, Sinclair&#x2019;s novel caused public outrage and eventually led to the passing of the Meat Inspection Act and the Pure Food and Drug Act.<br><br>Packaged in handsome, affordable trade editions, Clydesdale Classics is a new series of essential literary works.

The radio begins to play--"soul" music--and the car's side-view mirror begins to move, up, into the daylight.<br><br>We see the driver's bespectacled eyes in the rear-view mirror: eyes both haunted and alert.<br><br>The music pauses. We hear an announcement that MALCOLM X will be appearing at the Audubon Ballroom in the evening.<br><br>The side-view mirror, reflecting darkness, then light, then the traffic in the streets.<br><br>A red light; people crossing the street; soul music. <br><br>We now see the driver, MALCOLM X, bearded, harried, and yet, at the same time, calm and proud.<br><br>As the car begins to move again, the side-view mirror begins to reflect inexplicable images, swift, overlapping, blurred.<br><br>A fire fills the screen. Then, hooded men, on horseback, smashing in the windows of a country house; a fair, young mulatto woman, pregnant, flinching as the horsemen ride between her and the house; and between her and the camera.<br><br>A voice is heard, shouting, "Brothers, sisters, this is not our home! Our homeland is in Africa! In Africa!"<br><br>We hear a trolley-car's clanging bell, and see, from the point of view of the motorman, a beaten, one-eyed black man, lying across the streetcar tracks, watching his death approach.<br>MALCOLM's face.<br>The car is moving uptown, through the streets of Manhattan, and we watch MALCOLM watching the people and watching the tall, proud buildings. Following MALCOLM's eye, we begin picking out, isolating, certain details of these buildings:<br><br>A cupola, at the topmost height of a New York building, transforms itself, as we pass, into the balcony of the presidential mansion in Dakar: flags flying, throngs of black people cheering. The bearded MALCOLM is smiling and responding to the cheers.<br><br>A very young black STUDENT, male, with a bright and eager face, is speaking to him.)<br>STUDENT You must return. You must come back to us. <br><br>MALCOLM I have come back. After many centuries.<br>Thank you--thank you!--for welcoming me. You have given me a new name!<br>(MALCOLM, in a great hall, somewhere in Africa, being draped in an African robe.<br>The black ruler, who places this robe on him, pronounces this new name at the same time that MALCOLM repeats it to the STUDENT.)<br>MALCOLM Omowale.<br><br>STUDENT It means: the son who has returned.<br><br>MALCOLM I have had so many names--<br>(We see the Book of the Holy Register of True Muslims.

Go on, Red!"<br><br>MALCOLM acknowledges this, without missing a beat. He is dancing with a very young, radiant, black girl, LAURA. They execute a particularly spectacular and punishing pas de deux, the crowd roaring them on, and when MALCOLM has, literally, set LAURA's feet on solid ground again, he holds her against him a moment. They are very, very young: and they smile at each other that way.)<br>MALCOLM You are the cutest thing.<br><br>(MALCOLM'S present, weary, bearded face: very much alone. Idly, he watches a very attractive blond girl striding along the avenue.)<br>MALCOLM'S VOICE OVER Sophia--<br>(The car stops for a light.<br>The blond girl, who is actually not SOPHIA, enters a jewelry shop. We see her through the glass.<br><br>In the side-view mirror, we see:<br><br>MALCOLM'S long hands tangled in SOPHIA's long blond hair. They kiss--a long moment--and then we see that they are in a room, on a bed. SOPHIA is wearing a loose robe. MALCOLM is naked to the waist.)<br><br>MALCOLM And what you going to tell your white boy about your black boy? your fine black stud? your nigger?--You hear me talking to you, Miss Anne?<br><br>SOPHIA I am not going to speak about you at all.<br><br>MALCOLM Suppose somebody else tells him?<br><br>SOPHIA Who could make him believe it?<br><br>MALCOLM (laughs) You keep telling me you know how white men are.

He shows how garbage affects residents in vulnerable communities and poses health risks to those who dispose of it. He follows the trash, the pollution, the hazards, and the people who encountered them in the period 1880-2000. What unfolds is a tug of war among social movements, government, and industry over how we manage our waste, who benefits, and who pays the costs.Studies demonstrate that minority and low-income communities bear a disproportionate burden of environmental hazards. Pellow analyzes how and why environmental inequalities are created. He also explains how class and racial politics have influenced the waste industry throughout the history of Chicago and the United States. After examining the roles of social movements and workers in defining, resisting, and shaping garbage disposal in the United States, he concludes that some environmental groups and people of color have actually contributed to environmental inequality.By highlighting conflicts over waste dumping, incineration, landfills, and recycling, Pellow provides a historical view of the garbage industry throughout the life cycle of waste. Although his focus is on Chicago, he places the trends and conflicts in a broader context, describing how communities throughout the United States have resisted the waste industry's efforts to locate hazardous facilities in their backyards. The book closes with suggestions for how communities can work more effectively for environmental justice and safe, sustainable waste management.</p></p><p>"This is one of the most original, thought-provoking works on environmental justice that I have seen in some time. Its significance lies in Pellow's unique ability to get at the often unspoken issues that affect the movement and its future direction." <br>--Jim Schwab, American Planning Association, author of Deeper Shades of Green <p>"Pellow employs the notion of the &#x2018;treadmill of production&#x2019; along with theoretical insights from race and ethnic studies to reveal the contradictions and complexities of the urban recycling and waste management economy. With the publication of Garbage Wars, David Pellow has established himself as one of foremost theorists and researchers on environmental inequalities and environmental justice." <br>--Frederick H. Buttel, William H. Sewell Professor of Rural Sociology and Professor of Environmental Studies, University of Wisconsin, Madison </p><p>"David N. Pellow has written a unique study. Garbage Wars examines environmental racism and environmental justice from a variety of vantage points, including those of workers and whole neighborhoods. In doing so, he raises important questions about how society confronts its waste problems, and who ultimately pays for the choices made." <br>--Martin V. Melosi, Distinguished University Professor, University of Houston, Author of The Sanitary City: Urban Infrastructure in America from Colonial Times to the Present </p><p>"This is one of the most thoughtful and best-written works ever produced on environmental justice and injustice." <br>--William R. Freudenburg, Professor of Rural Sociology and Environmental Studies, University of Wisconsin--Madison </p><p>"Garbage Wars provides a detailed and fascinating historical account of an important environmental issue. David Pellow demonstrates that links between waste disposal and environmental injustice are not a recent phenomenon but rather have existed for a century and more. He shows that environmental inequalities result from a complex struggle among multiple stakeholders with varying interests and access to power. This is a truly groundbreaking work that uncovers the roots of an important environmental and social problem." <br>--Paul Mohai, School of Natural Resources and Environment, University of Michigan</p>David Naguib Pellow is Assistant Professor of Sociology and Ethnic Studies at the University of Colorado at Boulder.</p><h2>Philosophical Concepts in Physics: The Historical Relation between Philosophy and Scientific Theories</h2><p>This book examines a selection of philosophical issues in the context of specific episodes in the development of physical theories and presents scientific advances within their historical and philosophical contexts. Philosophical considerations have played an essential and ineliminable role in the actual practice of science. The book begins with some necessary introduction to the history of ancient and early modern science, but emphasizes the two great watersheds of twentieth-century physics: relativity and quantum mechanics. At times the term &#34;construction&#34; may seem more appropriate than &#34;discovery&#34; for the way theories have developed and, especially in later chapters, the discussion focuses on the influence of historical, philosophical and even social factors on the form and content of scientific theories.</p><p>Scientific knowledge, because of its putative certainty and objective method of discovery, is often seen as essentially different from other types of knowledge. As popularly understood, physics and philosophy might seem to be far removed from one another. However, this book demonstrates the essential and ineliminable role that philosophical considerations play in the construction of scientific knowledge. The discussion of central philosophical issues is anchored in the specific historical context and in the actual content of the relevant scientific advances.'For anyone who really wants to understand physics, this is a splendid and beautifully written book ... this book is an excellent introduction to a historically based philosophy of science, with accurate reporting of many examples from physics, and much attention to primary sources. I would recommend it strongly as an adjunct to standard textbooks of physics for students who seek a real understanding of their subject.' Michael Redhead, Physics World<br><br>'... I think that Cushing has done an excellent job. If I again teach a course similar to his I will certainly consider using his book as a text ...'. Anthony Leggett, The Times Higher Education Supplement<br><br>'As a chronological text in the history and philosophy of science for undergraduate students of the physical sciences, this book is unexcelled.'

R. Johnson&#x2019;s classic study of Vergil&#x2019;s <i>Aeneid</i> challenges centuries of received wisdom. Johnson rejects the political and historical reading of the epic as a record of the glorious prehistory of Rome and instead foregrounds Vergil&#x2019;s enigmatic style and questioning of the heroic myths.<br><br> With an approach to the text that is both grounded in scholarship and intensely personal, and in a style both rhetorically elegant and passionate, Johnson offers readings of specific passages that are nuanced and suggestive as he focuses on the somber and nourishing fictions&#x201d; in Vergil&#x2019;s poem. A timeless work of scholarship, <i>Darkness Visible</i> will enthrall classicists as well as students and scholars of the history of criticism specifically the way in which politics influence modern readings of the classics and of poetry and literature.</p><p><b>W. R. Johnson</b> is the John Matthews Manly Distinguished Service Professor Emeritus in the Department of Classics at the University of Chicago. He is the author of, among others, <i>Horace and the Dialectic of Freedom: Readings in </i>Epistles 1.&#x201c;This book remains as fresh and as challenging as when it first appeared. If I had to pick one single book as the book to tell young scholars to read on Vergil&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>Aeneid</i>, it would still be this one.&#x201d; (Denis Feeney, Princeton University)<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Darkness Visible&nbsp;</i>will always be one of the great works of Vergil criticism, and ancient literary criticism more generally.&#x201d; (Mark Payne, University of Chicago)<br><br>&#x201c;Johnson&#x2019;s reinterpretation challenges many strong and common beliefs, not only about the <i>Aeneid </i>but about life itself. Indeed, although the book deserves careful study for its readings of passages alone, it is no mere literary analysis, and herein lies its nobility.&#x201d; (William M.

The analyses of key passages from the <i>Aeneid</i> and from Greek epic (Homer and Apollonius) invite us to look more closely not only at the language, prosody, etc., but also at such matters as narrative distancing and the way the Latin poet identifies with his reader or enters into the mind of his characters. . . .

Guess again. As patients, we wrongly assume the "best" care is dependent mainly on the newest medications, the most complex treatments, and the smartest doctors. But Americans look for health-care solutions in the wrong places. For example, hundreds of thousands of lives could be saved each year if doctors reduced common errors and maximized preventive medicine.<br>For Dr. Robert Pearl, these kinds of mistakes are a matter of professional importance, but also personal significance: he lost his own father due in part to poor communication and treatment planning by doctors. And consumers make costly mistakes too: we demand modern information technology from our banks, airlines, and retailers, but we passively accept last century's technology in our health care.<br>Solving the challenges of health care starts with understanding these problems. <i>Mistreated</i> explains why subconscious misperceptions are so common in medicine, and shows how modifying the structure, technology, financing, and leadership of American health care could radically improve quality outcomes. This important book proves we can overcome our fears and faulty assumptions, and provides a roadmap for a better, healthier future.</p><p><b>Robert Pearl, MD</b>, is executive director and CEO of The Permanente Medical Group, responsible for the health care of 3.8 million Kaiser Permanente members, and he is the president and CEO of the Mid-Atlantic Permanente Medical Group. Selected by Modern Healthcare as one of the most powerful physician-leaders in the nation, Dr. Pearl keynotes around 15 events per year for audiences of up to 10K, hosted by organizations such as at the New England Journal of Medicine. He is on faculty at Stanford and has taught at Duke, UC Berkeley, and Harvard. His column on Forbes.com on the business and culture of health care includes articles, such as a conversation with Malcolm Gladwell, which received up to 500K views. Dr. Pearl has been featured in media outlets including Time, ABC News, USA Today, and NPR."<i>Mistreated</i> is a powerful read, an incredible insight into American health care, a mix of poignant personal memoir by a son, the clinical perspective of an experienced surgeon, and the vision and understanding that comes from being the CEO of one of the largest and best health care organizations in the country.

Stressing the history and theory of these mathematical concepts rather than the mechanics, the authors provide many insights into the development of quantum mechanics and present much hard-to-find material in a remarkably lucid, compact form.<br>After summarizing the historical background from Pythagoras to Francis Bacon, Professors Yourgrau and Mandelstram cover Fermat's principle of least time, the principle of least action of Maupertuis, development of this principle by Euler and Lagrange, and the equations of Lagrange and Hamilton. Equipped by this thorough preparation to treat variational principles in general, they proceed to derive Hamilton's principle, the Hamilton-Jacobi equation, and Hamilton's canonical equations.<br>An investigation of electrodynamics in Hamiltonian form covers next, followed by a resume of variational principles in classical dynamics. The authors then launch into an analysis of their most significant topics: the relation between variational principles and wave mechanics, and the principles of Feynman and Schwinger in quantum mechanics. Two concluding chapters extend the discussion to hydrodynamics and natural philosophy.<br>Professional physicists, mathematicians, and advanced students with a strong mathematical background will find this stimulating volume invaluable reading.

But today it is culture that stands at the heart of the American enterprise, mass entertainment the economic dynamo that brings the public into the consuming fold and consolidates the power of business over the American mind. For a decade <em>The Baffler</em> has been the invigorating voice of dissent against these developments, in the grand tradition of the muckrakers and The American Mercury. This collection gathers the best of its writing to explore such peculiar developments as the birth of the rebel hero as consumer in the pages of <em>Wired</em> and <em>Details</em>; the ever-accelerating race to market youth culture; the rise of new business gurus like Tom Peters and the fad for Hobbesian corporate "reengineering"; and the encroachment of advertising and commercial enterprise into every last nook and cranny of American life. With its liberating attitude and cant-free intelligence, this book is a powerful polemic against the designs of the culture business on us all.</p><p>In this thought-provoking collection of essays, editor Thomas Frank and other contributors to the contrarian journal the <i>Baffler</i> examine the unprecedented ascendancy of business as <i>the</i> dominating force in American life. If the closest historical parallel is with the Gilded Age and its all-powerful robber barons, Frank and his ilk clearly see themselves as the muckrakers out to expose the absurdities and abuses of big business. Today, however, advertising has come to permeate every aspect of our society, and corporations are in the business of manufacturing culture--what Frank calls the "Culture Trust." These essays analyze the ways in which this Culture Trust has co-opted the power of dissent by appropriating the language and symbolism of nonconformist youth culture, from hippie slang to grunge fashion; in other words, when the media markets rebellion, it becomes just another consumer choice. As evidence, the essayists explore the image of consumer as rebel pioneered by publications such as <i>Details</i> and <i>Wired</i>, as well as the preeminence of "revolutionary" business gurus such as Tom Peters. The result is a highly original book, a satirical and savage indictment of '90s consumerist culture.The 1980s and 1990s have seen an enormous increase in the power of business over the American mind. Not since the Gilded Age have the robber barons of business accumulated more wealth or won more popular attention. But where the tycoons of yore built railroads or banks, today culture stands at the heart of American enterprise and mass entertainment has become its economic dynamo. For a decade The Baffler magazine has been an invigorating voice of dissent against these developments, in the tradition of the muckrakers and H. L. Mencken&#39;s The American Mercury. Commodity Your Dissent gathers together the best of its excoriating criticism of the new American cultural order, exploring such peculiar developments as the birth of the rebel consumer as hero in the pages of Wired and Details; the dramatic rise of &#34;alternative&#34; culture in the post-Nirvana era; the appearance of new business gurus like Tom Peters and corporate fads like &#34;reengineering&#34;; the ever-accelerating race to market youth culture; and the encroachment of advertising and commercial enterprise into every last nook and cranny of American life.</p><h2>Fluid Mechanics</h2><p><p>Fluid mechanics, the study of how fluids behave and interact under various forces and in various applied situations&#x2015;whether in the liquid or gaseous state or both&#x2015;is introduced and comprehensively covered in this widely adopted text.

For centuries, Macau was one of the world&#x2019;s greatest trading&nbsp;ports: a Portuguese outpost and crossroads along the spice route, where&nbsp;travelers from Europe, Southeast Asia, South Asia, and mainland China&nbsp;traded resources, culture, and food. <i>The Adventures of Fat Rice</i> is the&nbsp;story of how two Chicago chefs discovered and fell in love with this&nbsp;fascinating and, at least until now, unheralded cuisine. With dishes like&nbsp;Minchi (a classic Macanese meat hash), Po Kok Gai&nbsp;(a Portuguese-influenced chicken curry with chouri�o and olives), and&nbsp;Arroz Gordo (if paella and fried rice had a baby), now you, too, can bring&nbsp;the eclectic and wonderfully unique&#x2014;yet enticingly familiar&#x2014;flavors of&nbsp;Macau into your own kitchen.</p><p>ABRAHAM CONLON and ADRIENNE LO are the chefs and co-owners of the popular Chicago restaurant Fat Rice.

The idea for this tasty treat came from the Yat Heng Tong Bakery on the island of Taipa during our first trip to Macau. There we found a Taiwanese baker making crisp puffed rice balls coated with all kinds of things, but the one that stood out for us was the one with nori and rousong (pork floss)&#x2014;a weirdly delicious, fluffy, MSG-laden porcine treat. The balls had the texture similar to Rice Krispies Treats, with a super-addictive, slightly oceanic, and savory taste. Back home, we added sesame and chilli flakes, and the dynamic texture of not-melted-all-the-way marshmallows for a strangely delicious taste combination of sweet and salty, with a bonus porky flavor putting it over the top. Making this dessert is a rite of passage at Fat Rice that all new cooks need to master, and it is always interesting to watch how someone not from the United States (and therefore, who has never made or even experienced Rice Krispies Treats before) interprets the recipe.<br> &nbsp;<br> 10 nori sheets, about 7 by 8 inches <br> 1 cup rousing<br> 9 ounces (about 11 cups) puffed rice cereal<br> 1 tablespoon sesame seeds, toasted<br> 1 tablespoon Korean chili flakes<br> 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus a bit to grease hands<br> &nbsp;� teaspoon salt<br> 1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil<br> 1 (28-ounce) bag marshmallows<br> &nbsp;<br> Finely julienne the nori sheets into strips about 1 inch long&#x2014;you&#x2019;ll need a good, sharp knife and some serious elbow grease, or take the nori into your office after everyone else is gone and use the boss&#x2019;s paper cutter.<br> &nbsp;<br> On the bottom of a dry 9 by 13-inch baking dish, first sprinkle half of the rousong, then half of the nori on top of the pork and set aside. You want the pork floss to be on the outside of both sides of the rice crisps or the seaweed will not adhere.<br> &nbsp;<br> Toss the cereal, sesame seeds, and Korean chilli flakes in a bowl and set aside.<br> &nbsp;<br> Melt the butter with the salt and sesame oil in the biggest and widest pot you&#x2019;ve got. Add the marshmallows and stir to slightly melt, taking care not to melt them more than about halfway, just a few min�utes. Remove from the heat and immediately add the cereal mixture, stirring well to combine. With buttered hands, press the cereal mixture firmly and evenly onto the floss and seaweed in the baking dish, pressing into an even layer. Top with the remaining seaweed, fol�lowed by the remaining pork floss. Top with parchment paper and weight down with another baking dish or something similar. Allow to cool for 1 hour, weighted, then remove from the pan and cut into serving-size portions. Serve immediately. Store any leftovers tightly wrapped at room temperature for up to 5 days.</p><h2>A Dictionary of World History (Oxford Quick Reference)</h2><p>This wide-ranging dictionary contains a wealth of information on all aspects of history, from prehistory right up to the present day.

It provides a single strand of simple techniques for the central business of modern logic. Basic formal concepts are explained, the paraphrasing of words into symbols is treated at some length, and a testing procedure is given for truth-function logic along with a complete proof procedure for the logic of quantifiers. Fully one third of this revised edition is new, and presents a nearly complete turnover in crucial techniques of testing and proving, some change of notation, and some updating of terminology. The study is intended primarily as a convenient encapsulation of minimum essentials, but concludes by giving brief glimpses of further matters.</p><p>W. V.

This book describes an intensive therapeutic approach designed to completely change the criminals way of thinking. The authors reject traditional treatment approaches as reinforcing of the criminals sense of being a victim of society. Rather Yochelson and Samenow stress that the criminal must make a choice to give up criminal thinking and learn morality. A Jason Aronson Book</p><p>Samuel Yochelson, Ph.D., M.D., was until his death in 1976, director of the Program for the Investigation of Criminal Behavior at Saint Elizabeths Hospital, Washington, D.C. and research professor of clinical psychiatry at George Washington University School of Medicine Stanton E. Samenow, Ph.D., is a clinical psychologist in Alexandria, Virginia. He is also the co-author of The Criminal Personality, Volume II: The Change Process, and The Criminal Personality: Volume I, A Profile for Change.Yochelson and Samenow have definitely profiled the characteristics of the errors of criminal thinking, together with their derivatives&#x2013;feeling and behavior. They show persuasively that because of ingrained and pervasive errors of thinking, criminals live and act in a world with entirely different assumptive bases than those of noncriminals. The authors then proceed to develop a treatment program using a phenomenological approach. This exhaustive and painstaking study marks a turning point in the history of efforts to rehabilitate criminals. (W. Edward Naugler M.D.)<br><br>Drs. Yochelson and Samenow's work constitutes an unprecedented scrutiny of criminal behavior, going beyond mere microscopic analysis. Volume II makes good the promise expressed in Volume I: that the fruition of fifteen years of research would be no less than an entirely new approach to understanding and modifying the criminal's thought patterns.

West&#x2019;s vision of American modernity is terrifyingly comical and diagnoses the tawdriness and meretriciousness of much of American popular culture. His greatest work, Miss Lonelyhearts, which begins this collection, is unique in modern literature. It describes New York in the early years of the Great Depression through the point of view of an &#x2018;agony aunt&#x2019; who corresponds with his suffering readers in the guise of Miss Lonelyhearts: &#x2018;(Are you in trouble? &#x2013; Do you need advice?)&#x2019;. A Cool Million is, as its subtitle suggests, the &#x2018;dismantling&#x2019; of a myth, here a caustic satire of the &#x2018;rags to riches&#x2019; story. West&#x2019;s final novel, The Day of the Locust, is a comic, yet apocalyptic account of the fantasies of 1930s Hollywood. This volume concludes with West&#x2019;s parodic and surreal first venture into fiction, The Dream Life of Balso Snell. Henry Claridge&#x2019;s introduction to this new edition of West&#x2019;s fictional writings contextualises his work in the United States of the Great Depression, in his evocation of 1930s Hollywood (where he worked as a writer of screenplays), and in the larger context of his Eastern European Jewish background, and, particularly, his reading of Dostoyesvky. The text comes with extensive annotations, a note on the textual history of West&#x2019;s writings, and a guide to further reading for both the student and the general reader.</p></p><p>Nathanael West (1903-1940) was not widely known when he died in a car crash with his wife.

The interaction of the authors with students at the Short Course on Scanning Electron Microscopy and X-Ray Microanalysis held annually at Lehigh University has helped greatly in developing this textbook. The material has been chosen to provide a student with a general introduction to the techniques of scanning electron microscopy and x-ray microanalysis suitable for application in such fields as biology, geology, solid state physics, and materials science. Following the format of PSEM, this book gives the student a basic knowledge of (1) the user-controlled functions of the electron optics of the scanning electron microscope and electron microprobe, (2) the characteristics of electron-beam-sample inter� actions, (3) image formation and interpretation, (4) x-ray spectrometry, and (5) quantitative x-ray microanalysis. Each of these topics has been updated and in most cases expanded over the material presented in PSEM in order to give the reader sufficient coverage to understand these topics and apply the information in the laboratory. Throughout the text, we have attempted to emphasize practical aspects of the techniques, describing those instru� ment parameters which the microscopist can and must manipulate to obtain optimum information from the specimen. Certain areas in particular have been expanded in response to their increasing importance in the SEM field.

Such question-and-answer sessions provide an opportunity for the authors to expand on key points and principles within their book, as well as address important topics that were not included in BODY BY SCIENCE (such as rehabilitation issues, various training protocols, and long term health and safety issues). THE BODY BY SCIENCE QUESTION-AND-ANSWER BOOK is a companion volume to BODY BY SCIENCE that sheds additional light on the authors&#39; rational, science-based approach to strength training, bodybuilding, and total fitness. Within the pages of this new book you will learn: -Why (and how) strength training is the best way to rehabilitate most common injuries (from rotator cuff issues and knee replacements to lower back pain and arthritis). -Why bodybuilding is not what it seems. -Why athletics may not be the best route to health and fitness -The truth about VO2 Max testing and REAL cardiovascular health. -The realities of nutrition and the &#34;insulin problem.&#34; -How to optimize your workouts and ensure that your training facility is set up to maximize your progress. Plus answers to many more important questions on various aspects of health, fitness and strength.</p><p></p><h2>The Dame: An Alan Grofield Novel</h2><p><p>Donald E. Westlake is one of the greats of crime fiction. Under the pseudonym Richard Stark, he wrote twenty-four fast-paced, hardboiled novels featuring Parker, a shrewd career criminal with a talent for heists. Using the same nom de plume, Westlake also completed a separate series in the Parker universe, starring Alan Grofield, an occasional colleague of Parker. While he shares events and characters with several Parker novels, Grofield is less calculating and more hot-blooded than Parker; think fewer guns, more dames.</p> <p>Not that there isn&#x2019;t violence and adventure aplenty. . <i>The Dame</i> finds Grofield in Puerto Rico protecting a rich, demanding woman in her isolated jungle villa, and reluctantly assuming the role of detective. A rare Westlake take on a whodunit, <i>The Dame</i> features a cast of colorful characters and a suspenseful&#x2014;and memorable&#x2014;climax.</p> <p>With a new foreword by Sarah Weinman that situates the Grofield series within Westlake&#x2019;s work as a whole, this novel is an exciting addition to any crime fiction fan&#x2019;s library.</p></p><p><b>Richard Stark</b> was one of the many pseudonyms of Donald E.

It provides a thorough but very accessible linguistic/psycholinguistic examination of the lowest levels of the reading process. It is both theoretical and practical. The goal is to balance or supplement (not replace) top-down approaches and methodologies with effective low-level options for teaching English reading. Core linguistic and psycholinguistic concepts are presented within the context of their application to teaching.<br>&nbsp;<br>The text clearly explains the strategies that readers of other languages develop in response to their own writing systems (Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, Hebrew, other alphabets, or transparent Roman alphabetic systems), contrasted with an explanation of the strategies that English readers develop in response to the opaque orthography of English, and explicates how other low-level processing strategies for L1 morphology and word formation may aid or hinder processing in English L2 reading acquisition.<br>&nbsp;<br>A complete, balanced reading ideology should be big enough to embrace all reading theories and practices. In particular, it should be able to accommodate those researchers and teachers who find that attention to the details of language can also help students learn to read better. Many ESL/EFL teachers are interested in supplementing their successful whole-language methods with bottom-up reading strategies, but aren&#x2019;t sure how to do it.

In countering asymmetric threats and non-state adversaries, the model is simply outmoded. A flatter, horizontal, networked solution has proven much more effective in today's world. <p>In his second edition, Robert Clark--former CIA analyst and executive in the Intelligence Directorate--explains how a collaborative, target-centric process both attends to the needs of the customer and promotes more effective collection. Based on feedback from users, early chapters introduce the concept of model synthesis more gradually. Recent intelligence events--with the Iraqi WMD Commission Report at center stage--illustrate the importance of target-centric analysis. This revision also includes broader treatment of collection strategies, systems analysis, and analyst-customer interaction as well as more attention to denial and deception, and to both counterterrorism and counterintelligence analysis. </p><p>This new edition contains updates of the practical information and day-to-day details from the previous book told as only an experienced intelligence hand could. Extensive descriptions of the art of target modeling and organizational analysis, as well as thoroughly detailed overviews of the quantitative and predictive techniques used in intelligence analysis make this book an essential tool for illuminating an often shadowy world.</p></p><p><b>Robert M.

To use mathematics, one needs to understand the physical context. The author uses mathematical techniques along with observations and experiments to give an in-depth look at models for mechanical vibrations, population dynamics, and traffic flow. Equal emphasis is placed on the mathematical formulation of the problem and the interpretation of the results. In the sections on mechanical vibrations and population dynamics, the author emphasizes the nonlinear aspects of ordinary differential equations and develops the concepts of equilibrium solutions and their stability. He introduces phase plane methods for the nonlinear pendulum and for predator-prey and competing species models.</p><p>&#39;Before courses in math modeling became de rigueur, Richard Haberman had already demonstrated that mathematical techniques could be unusually effective in understanding elementary mechanical vibrations, population dynamics, and traffic flow, as well as how such intriguing applications could motivate the further study of nonlinear ordinary and partial differential equations.

As a comprehensive and critical account of knowledge and research in the field of culture theory, leading social scientists explore the implications for understanding different aspects of subjective experience, social practice, and individual behavior. The focus of the volume is on the role of symbols and meaning in the development of mind, self, and emotion. They examine the content of culture and how it interacts with cognitive, social, and emotional growth; how ideas relate to attitudes, feelings, and behavior; how concepts and meanings are historically transmitted. They also explore methodological and conceptual problems involved in the definition and study of meaning, and revisit the perennial problem of &#39;relativism&#39; in light of topical advances in semantic analysis and in culture theory.

She charts the relationship between London&#x2019;s formation into a modern organized city in the 1860s and the emergence of new types of production and consumption of visual culture. She considers the role visual images played in the creation of a vibrant and diverse urban culture and how new kinds of publics were created for these representations. Shifting the focus of the history of modernity from Paris to London, Nead here argues for a different understanding of gender and public space in a society where women joined the everyday life of city streets and entered the debates concerning morality, spectacle, and adventure.<br>The book draws on texts and images of many kinds&#x2015;including acts of Parliament, literature, newspaper reports, private letters, maps, paintings, advertisements, posters, and banned obscene publications. Taking a highly interdisciplinary approach, Nead explores such intriguing topics as the efforts of urban improvers to move water, air, traffic, goods, and people in the Victorian metropolis; the impact of gas lighting and glass on urban leisure; and the obscenity legislation that emerged in response to new forms of visual mass culture that were perceived as dangerous and pervasive.</p><p><b>Lynda Nead</b> teaches history of art at Birkbeck College, University of London.<br><br><br>&#x201c;[This] genuinely interdisciplinary study . . . makes a major contribution to our knowledge of the lived experience of the Victorian city.&#x201d;&#x2014;Timothy Barringer, Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians<br><br><br>&#x201c;Provocative and brilliant.&#x201d;&#x2014;Susan P.

G. Wells</b>, is part of the <i><i>Barnes &amp; Noble Classics</i>&nbsp;</i>series, which offers quality editions at affordable prices to the student and the general reader, including new scholarship, thoughtful design, and pages of carefully crafted extras.

G. Wells</b>&#x2019;s first novel, is a tale of Darwinian evolution taken to its extreme. Its hero, a young scientist, travels 800,000 years into the future and discovers a dying earth populated by two strange humanoid species: the brutal Morlocks and the gentle but nearly helpless Eloi.<br><br><i>The Invisible Man</i> mixes chilling terror, suspense, and acute psychological understanding into a tale of an equally adventurous scientist who discovers the formula for invisibility&#x2014;a secret that drives him mad.<br><br>Immensely popular during his lifetime, H. G. Wells, along with Jules Verne, is credited with inventing science fiction. This new volume offers two of Wells&#x2019;s best-loved and most critically acclaimed &#x201c;scientific romances.&#x201d; In each, the author grounds his fantastical imagination in scientific fact and conjecture while lacing his narrative with vibrant action, not merely to tell a &#x201c;ripping yarn,&#x201d; but to offer a biting critique on the world around him. &#x201c;The strength of Mr. Wells,&#x201d; wrote Arnold Bennett, &#x201c;lies in the fact that he is not only a scientist, but a most talented student of character, especially quaint character. He will not only ingeniously describe for you a scientific miracle, but he will set down that miracle in the midst of a country village, sketching with excellent humour the inn-landlady, the blacksmith, the chemist&#x2019;s apprentice, the doctor, and all the other persons whom the miracle affects.&#x201d;&nbsp;<b>Alfred Mac Adam</b> teaches literature at Barnard College-Columbia University. He is a translator and art critic.</p><p><b>Alfred Mac Adam</b> teaches literature at Barnard College-Columbia University. He is a translator and art critic.<b>From Alfred Mac Adam&#x2019;s Introduction to <i>The Time Machine and The Invisible Man</i></b> <br><br><i>The Time Machine</i> (1895) and <i>The Invisible Man</i> (1897) are now more than a century old. Yet they endure as literary texts, radio plays, and movies, because they appeal directly to two of our deepest desires: immortality and omnipotence. The time machine would allow us to escape death and gain knowledge of the fate of the earth, while invisibility would enable us to go and come as we please, under the noses of friends and enemies. At the same time, both fictions show us the dangers of fulfilled wishes: The Time Traveller discovers the future of humanity is not bright but hideously dark, while the Invisible Man drowns in the madness brought about by his own experimentation.<br>Of course, what Herbert George Wells (1866&#x2013;1946) wanted to express in these fantasies and what generations of readers have made of them are two radically different things. Erroneously labeled &#x201c;science fiction,&#x201d; and tricked out in their film versions with all kinds of fanciful devices with flashing lights and ominous buzzers Wells never mentions, they are really tales that enact the author&#x2019;s theories and speculations about human society, human nature, and natural history in allegorical fashion. That is, the &#x201c;science&#x201d; in Wells&#x2019;s fictions is nothing more than stage machinery. But, ironically, it is the machinery that has come to dominate our collective imagination.<br>There is nothing unique in this. Think of <i>Gulliver&#x2019;s Travels</i> (whose long-forgotten original title is <i>Travels into Several Remote Nations of the World</i>), a book that Wells read as a boy and reread throughout his life. In 1726 Jonathan Swift (1667&#x2013;1745) satirized English political parties, religious quarrels, theories of world government, and science, but his work was so grounded in eighteenth-century British culture that today&#x2019;s readers need extensive preparation to fathom it. The story of Lemuel Gulliver&#x2019;s visits to lands populated by giants or intelligent horses has, however, become a staple of children&#x2019;s literature. The same applies to <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> (1719), by Daniel Defoe (1660&#x2013;1731). Only scholars see the relationship between Crusoe&#x2019;s shipwreck and Defoe&#x2019;s ideas on the fate of the middle classes during the Restoration, when Charles II returned to England in 1660. Defoe&#x2019;s message and all his political intentions have been lost, but his story endures as a wonderful demonstration of self-reliance. In the literature of the United States, we have the example of Herman Melville (1819&#x2013;1891) and his <i>Moby-Dick</i> (1851): Most readers learn about the ambiguous struggle between good and evil embedded in the work long after they&#x2019;ve read a novel about nineteenth-century whaling and the strange characters engaged in that dangerous work.<br>Much the same has taken place with Wells&#x2019;s <i>Time Machine</i> and <i>The Invisible Man</i>. Wells cloaked his ideas about the future of society and the role of science in the world so well that readers simply do not see those issues and instead read his short novels as examples of a kind of fiction based on the simplest of propositions: &#x201c;What if it were possible to travel through time by means of a machine?&#x201d; or &#x201c;What if it were possible to make oneself invisible?&#x201d; In a world&#x2014;one we share with Wells despite the fact that more than a hundred years separates the moment he published these two works from our own age&#x2014;when scientists seem to make discoveries every day, it requires no great leap of imagination, no &#x201c;willing suspension of disbelief,&#x201d; to accept the basic premise of each text.<br>This is what differentiates Wells from Jules Verne (1828&#x2013;1905), author of <i>Voyage to the Center of the Earth</i> (1864) and <i>Around the World in Eighty Days</i> (1873). Wells, in a 1934 preface to a collection of his early fictions comments on why they are not comparable to Verne&#x2019;s writings: <br><br>These tales have been compared with the work of Jules Verne and there was a disposition on the part of literary journalists at one time to call me the English Jules Verne. As a matter of fact there is no literary resemblance whatever between the anticipatory inventions of the great Frenchman and these fantasies. His work dealt almost always with actual possibilities of invention and discovery, and he made some remarkable forecasts. . . . But these stories of mine . . . do not pretend to deal with possible things; they are exercises of the imagination in a quite different field. They belong to a class of writing which includes the <i>Golden Ass of Apuleius</i>, the <i>True Histories of Lucian</i>, <i>Peter Schlemil</i>, and the story of <i>Frankenstein</i>. . . . They are all fantasies; they do not aim to project a serious possibility; they aim indeed only at the same amount of conviction as one gets in a good gripping dream (<i>The Complete Science Fiction Treasury of H. G. Wells</i>). <br><br>Wells links himself to a tradition, but at the same time he misleads the reader. It is true, as he says in the same preface, that &#x201c;The invention is nothing in itself,&#x201d; by which he means that the applied science of Verne is of no interest in his kind of tale. It is also the reason why rediscoveries of Verne, especially films, are always set in the past: His projections became fact very quickly. By the same token, this explains why Wells&#x2019;s inventions and their ramifications will always be modern.<br><br></p><h2>Depression For Dummies</h2><p>"What do you have to be depressed about?"

While the buildings were being torn down, he preserved them photographically. </p><p> Burden's first lesson in architectural salvage came as a result of that same urban renewal project, when he rescued the roof of an old Gothic church that stood in the path of the destruction. A self-styled PR blitz saved the roof and the effort was given a Special Commendation Award from the California Heritage Council. </p><p> The first project he designed as an architect involved converting an abandoned warehouse into an upscale nightclub, featuring all exposed materials and in interior atrium. </p><p> His first book was a self-published work: <i>San Francisco's Wildflower: The Palace of Fine Arts.</i> The book documented the story of Bernard Maybeck's masterpiece, which was built as a temporary structure, and then demolished decades later and reconstructed in permanent materials.

I was attentive and labored to find out if there was any gold.""<br><br>With these portentous words, Christopher Columbus described one of his first encounters with Native Americans on the island of Guanahani, which he had named San Salvador and claimed for Spain the day before.

Quoting liberally from what remains of Columbus&#x2019;s logs and other firsthand accounts, William Least Heat-Moon takes you aboard the three tiny vessels as they set out on the voyage that would change the world forever. He recreates the anxiety of their first Atlantic crossing, explains the errors in Columbus&#x2019;s belief that he could reach the Far East by sailing west, and gives detailed accounts of his dealings with the Tainos, the first Native Americans Columbus met.</p><p>Columbus emerges in these pages as a brilliant, driven, and flawed man whose courage and feats of navigation were limited by his inflexibility and overshadowed by his frequently harsh treatment of Indians and his quest for wealth and glory. In his own words, he reveals both his refusal to believe that he had not reached the Far East and his astonishingly cold-hearted plan for the future of the Tainos, whom he claimed to respect and admire.</p><p>The profound impact of the voyages of Columbus affects us still today, bringing opportunity and freedom to millions of people and disaster and doom to millions more. Columbus in the Americas describes the events of each Columbian voyage in vivid detail and assesses his legacy. It tells both a remarkable story of adventure and triumph and a cautionary tale of the dark side of discovery.</p>WILLIAM LEAST HEAT-MOON is the New York Times bestselling author of Blue Highways, PrairyErth, and River-Horse.

Stimson Lectures Series)</h2><p><b>What really happened in the centuries of conflict between Europe, Russia, China, America, and the peoples of the Muslim world</b><br> &nbsp;<br><i>Crusade and Jihad</i> is the first book to encompass, in one volume, the entire history of the catastrophic encounter between the Global North&#x2014;China, Russia, Europe, Britain, and America&#x2014;and Muslim societies from Central Asia to West Africa. William R. Polk draws on more than half a century of experience as a historian, policy planner, diplomat, peace negotiator, and businessman to explain the deep hostilities between the Muslim world and the Global North and show how they grew over the centuries.<br> &nbsp;<br> Polk shows how Islam arose and spread across North Africa into Europe, climaxed in the vibrant and sophisticated caliphate of al-Andalus in medieval Spain, and was the bright light in a European Dark Age. Simultaneously, Islam spread from the Middle East into Africa, India, and Southeast Asia. But following the Mongol invasions, Islamic civilization entered a decline while Europe began its overseas expansion. Portuguese buccaneers dominated the Indian Ocean; the Dutch and the English established powerful corporations that turned India and Indonesia into colonies; Russian armies pushed down the Volga into Central Asia, destroying its city-states; and the Chinese Qing dynasty slaughtered an entire Central Asian people. Britain crushed local industry and drained off wealth throughout its vast colonies. Defeated at every turn, Muslims tried adopting Western dress, organizing Westernstyle armies, and embracing Western ideas.<br> &nbsp;<br> None of these efforts stopped the conquests. For Europe and Russia, the nineteenth century was an age of colonial expansion, but for the Muslim world it was an age of brutal and humiliating defeat. Millions were driven from their homes, starved, or killed, and their culture and religion came under a century-long assault.<br> &nbsp;<br> In the twentieth century, brutalized and and disorganized native societies, even after winning independence, fell victim to &#x201c;post-imperial malaise,&#x201d; typified by native tyrannies, corruption, and massive poverty. The result was a furious blowback.<br> &nbsp;<br> A sobering, scrupulous, and frank account of imperialism, colonialism, insurgency, and terrorism, <i>Crusade and Jihad</i> is history for anyone who wishes to understand the civilizational conflicts of today&#x2019;s world.</p><p>Peoples and governments from China, Russia, Europe, Britain, and America are generally ignorant of the tragic events of imperialism, whereas the victims remember them vividly. In our joint quest for security, the necessary first step is to know how we interacted. To provide what we need to know is the aim of this book.<b>William R.

This book brings unparalleled clarity to the contemporary debate over this question. Maintaining that cultures are themselves torn by conflicts about their own boundaries, Seyla Benhabib challenges the assumption shared by many theorists and activists that cultures are clearly defined wholes. She argues that much debate--including that of "strong" multiculturalism, which sees cultures as distinct pieces of a mosaic--is dominated by this faulty belief, one with grave consequences for how we think injustices among groups should be redressed and human diversity achieved. Benhabib masterfully presents an alternative approach, developing an understanding of cultures as continually creating, re-creating, and renegotiating the imagined boundaries between "us" and "them."</p><br><p>Drawing on contemporary cultural politics from Western Europe, Canada, and the United States, Benhabib develops a double-track model of deliberative democracy that permits maximum cultural contestation within the official public sphere as well as in and through social movements and the institutions of civil society. Agreeing with political liberals that constitutional and legal universalism should be preserved at the level of polity, she nonetheless contends that such a model is necessary to resolve multicultural conflicts.</p><br><p>Analyzing in detail the transformation of citizenship practices in European Union countries, Benhabib concludes that flexible citizenship, certain kinds of legal pluralism and models of institutional powersharing are quite compatible with deliberative democracy, as long as they are in accord with egalitarian reciprocity, voluntary self-ascription, and freedom of exit and association. <i>The Claims of Culture</i> offers invaluable insight to all those, whether students or scholars, lawyers or policymakers, who strive to bridge the gap between the theory and practice of cultural politics in the twenty-first century.</p></p><p><p>"A brave and beautiful book that grows in power and poignancy after 9/11. Rejecting the dismal view that the global world will be mired in the 'clash of civilizations' and the culture wars, Benhabib restores our faith in the human need to narrativize the historical and cultural experiences of self and other. This wonderful work allows us to hope that the contested conversations of mankind may converge in the intricate dialogues of the democratic process."<b>--Homi K. Bhabha, Harvard University</b></p><p>"Seyla Benhabib's book presents a subtly defined, vigorously argued universalist position in democratic theory, one that nevertheless accommodates (and essentially integrates) varieties of multiculturalism. It is especially notable for going beyond the trite oppositions between the politics of cultural identity and the theory of deliberative democracy."<b>--Amelie Rorty, Brandeis University</b></p><p>"Reading this book was a deeply satisfying experience. Benhabib's model of democracy is firmly rooted in a systematic and well-developed moral theory, and her policy recommendations are informed both by extensive philosophical reflection and by her uncompromising commitment to individual identity."<b>--Alison Jaggar, University of Colorado</b></p><b>Seyla Benhabib</b> is Eugene Meyer Professor of Political Science and Philosophy at Yale University. Her books include <i>Transformations of Citizenship (The Spinoza Lectures), The Reluctant Modernism of Hannah Arendt</i>, and <i>Situating the Self</i>.

The correpsondence between Beckett and Schneider offers a picture of the art and craft of theatre in the hands of two masters. Alan Schneider premiered five of Beckett&#39;s plays in the USA, including &#34;Waiting for Godot&#34;, &#34;Krapp&#39;s Last Tape&#34;, and &#34;Endgame&#34;, and directed a number of revivals. Preparing for each new production, the two wrote extensive letters - about intended tone, conception of characters, irony and verbal echoes, staging details for scenes, and delivery of individual lines. From such details a sense of the playwright&#39;s vision emerges, as well as a feel for the director&#39;s task. The correspondence starts in December 1955, shortly after their first meeting, and continues to Schneider&#39;s accidental death in March 1984 (when crossing a street to mail a letter to Beckett). The 500 letters featured capture the world of theatre as well as the personalities of their authors.</p><p>An absorbing edition of the correspondence between the playwright and the director. -- Fintan O'Toole "New York Review of Books" "No Author Better Served" has been edited with a useful introduction and great textual care...Beckett's letters often reveal not only his uninterrupted faith in Schneider but a charming modesty, an engaging self-deprecation...In return, Schneider, often using gloomy phrases from Beckett's plays, sends his friend his despairing reflections on the state of the American theater, American culture and American politics. -- Robert Brustein "New York Times Book Review" Beckett was adamant about not wanting his letters published, but Beckett was frequently wrong ('I cannot help feeling, ' he writes, 'that the success of Godot has been very largely the result of a misunderstanding'). Whatever was personal has been excised from the 500 missives that make up this book, but what remains includes vivid and often revelatory material about his interpretations of his own work. Schneider, who introduced many of the masterworks to this country, as an able and often provocatively inquisitive correspondent. The result is an enlightening volume that closes with a Beckettian twist: Schneider died in 1984 in an accident as he was crossing a street to mail a letter to Beckett Samuel Beckett's disdain for critics is among revelations in this extraordinary collection of more than 500 letters...The 30-year correspondence between Beckett and Alan Schneider, who staged the American premieres of dramas such as "Waiting For Godot..".is virtually a history of Beckett's growth as a dramatist. The letters are all the more significant because Beckett rarely discussed his work in public, dismissing questions with comments such as, 'I meant what I said.' The letters offer an unparalleled insight into the playwright who died in 1989 at the age of 89 and influenced writers from Harold Pinter to Tom Stoppard with his poetic pessimism and explorations of the big questions of human existence. -- Dalya Alberge "The Times" These letters are of particular interest in matters of Beckett's stagecraft and self-interpretation...The notoriously demanding playwright favored Schneider, as Maurice Harmon explains in his concisely excellent introduction, because Schneider 'did not intrude upon the work but submitted himself attentively to it, discovering its imaginative inner life'...Scrupulous, too, is editor Harmon who supplies useful and thorough notes for each letter. Taken together, the Beckett-Schneider letters also offer a unique overview of Beckett's stage work in the US...We are privy to their expert comments on the successes and failures of other Beckett productions here and abroad...A well-edited set of documents that will be uniquely invaluable to students of Beckett's works and of the American theater.

The playwright was always adamant: productions should follow his stage directions explicitly. In a new book, "No Author Better Served", a collection of 30 years of letters between Beckett and his director Alan Schneider, the playwright offers fascinating insights about performance and interpretation if not meaning.--Mel Gussow "New York Times " [Samuel Beckett's] disdain for critics is among revelations in [this] extraordinary collection of more than 500 letters...The 30-year correspondence between Beckett and Alan Schneider, who staged the American premieres of dramas such as "Waiting For Godot"...is virtually a history of Beckett's growth as a dramatist.

But "No Author Better Served"...reveals a different portrait of a writer...The letters show not only a demanding artist but also a kind and gentle man...This epistolary dialogue reveals a playwright's vision that gradually transformed our sense of the world and ultimately won the 1969 Nobel Prize for Literature. The correspondence also shows Schneider's importance in developing and implementing that vision.--Lisa Meyer "Los Angeles Times " Beckett's responses...are always entertaining and often enlightening. The book is sure to become required reading for graduate students and is a must for anyone interested in staging any one of Beckett's self-proclaimed 'monsters.'--Chris Davis "Memphis Flyer " This is a good-hearted book compiled, unwittingly, over 30 years by two very good-hearted people. The playwright who changed the course of twentieth-century drama exchanged regular letters with his adoring director in America. And their letters are gathered here together like a long and tender conversation...At the beginning and at the end of the game, Sam is always funny. In his despair, there is a chuckle; in his blackest threnodies, a modicum of wit...Read it if you love Beckett--and even, more importantly, read it if you don't...The spirit of these two good men will protect the future from the grey and miserable nonsense that many academics try to wrap round Beckett.--Peter Hall "The Observer " The letters to Schneider are overwhelmingly concerned with the details of the production and reception of Beckett's plays in America. About these matters they are packed with information, making this an indispensable work.--Hugh Haughton "London Review of Books " The great virtue of this correspondence is that Beckett, especially in the years between "Godot" and "Film," offers Schneider as much help in matters of interpretation great and small as any director could possible have expected. What Beckett called 'the making relation', emphasizing that this was the only (and itself a tenuous) relationship he could have with his own work, is here presented in unprecedented and unparalleled detail, so that no interpreter, on the stage or on the page, will be able to ignore it. Almost all Beckett's plays can be seen in a new light in this correspondence, but there are particularly extensive entries on "Waiting for Godot," "Krapp's Last Tape," "Happy Days," "Play," and "Not I," and almost an overplus of detail when it comes to the 1964 version of "Film" with Buster Keaton. Schneider's letters on their own would be valuable as a record of a great director working all over the world with great (and, more often, not so great) actors and technical staff. Bu It is only with the publication of the correspondence, of which that with Schneider is a small yet vital part, that the extent of Beckett's investment in the practicalities of the world can be fully appreciated. He was one of the great letter-writers of our era, indeed of any era: not just by the volume of his correspondents and letters...[but] by the extraordinary quality of his attentiveness, both to the person he was addressing and to whatever they were discussing. His letters have an utter lack of pretension or posture, reminiscent of Kafka's in their luminous directness...What is unique about this correspondence is the fact that...both sides survive almost intact, a witness to thirty years of intense and fertile exchange. Schneider's energy bristles on every page...Harvard University Press has done a fine job on this volume, leaving just enough blank page to let each letter breathe. The editor, Maurice Harmon, presents a virtually flawless text, having painstakingly transcribed wh Maurice Harmon's scrupulously edited volume is absolutely essential reading for all students of Beckett and for anyone with even a passing interest in the terrors, ignominy and glorious rewards of theatre. The editor is to be complimented for his honouring of the Beckett Estate's request for the exclusion from the letters of matter merely personal and private...Such editorial tact is rare and welcome. This is a volume to visit and revisit and deeply breathe of its 'vivifying air.--Gerry Dukes "Irish Independent " Emily Dickinson famously wanted her poems destroyed, a desire that, thankfully, was ignored. For similar reasons, one can only be grateful that Harmon--a professor at University College, Dublin--persisted in bringing to light an exchange that further illuminates Beckett's prismatic genius. Gossip-mongers may be put off that there aren't more personal revelations...What Harmon's excavation invaluably offers instead is a record of a sustained creative partnership virtually unique in the postwar theater...For most readers the collection will be of interest as an insight into Beckett's famously elusive and reluctant interpretations of his own gift.--Matt Wolf "San Francisco Examiner &amp; Chronicle " Given that his characters have such a fractured, antagonistic relationship with the world, you might imagine Beckett himself to have been locked in a kind of manic Salinger-like seclusion. Not at all: the sense of the man you get from the letters here is of a highly considerate, friendly and decent human being--and one who has no more problems dealing with the quotidian than you or I...It is almost funny to think of Beckett in the real world; which is probably one reason why he was stalked by so many devotees, anxious to touch the hem of his garment. And it is why this correspondence, ably and tactfully edited, will be happily fallen on by academics, students, and cranky fans...who will recognise it as a motherlode of tangential information...There could be no comparable correspondence, I think, about [Beckett's] prose.--Nicholas Lezard "Sunday Times " The playwright Samuel Beckett's letters to his devoted American director reveal both an abiding affection for his longtime pen pal and an increasing rigidity and weariness of spirit. In 1999, the reviewer Robert Brustein said the book 'not only chronicles the almost symbiotic relationship between a great writer and a faithful disciple but adds invaluable epistolary material to the Beckett canon.--Scott Veale"New York Times Book Review" (01/20/2001) Though this 30-year correspondence between Samuel Beckett and theater director Alan Schneider will mainly be read by Beckett buffs, there is much to interest a wider audience...Proposals scotched by Beckett included a radio version of "Happy Days" with Edith Evans and a film of "Godot" by Roman Polanski. This epistolary friendship ended in 1984 when Schneider was killed while crossing a road to mail a letter to Beckett.--Emma Hagestadt and Christopher Hirst"The Independent" (11/04/2000)<b>From the Publisher</b><br>"[Samuel Beckett's] disdain for critics is among revelations in [this] extraordinary collection of more than 500 letters...The 30-year correspondence between Beckett and Alan Schneider, who staged the American premieres of dramas such as Waiting For Godot...is virtually a history of Beckett's growth as a dramatist.

Specific instructional strategies were developed for each of the primary sources based upon the five categories of historical thinking skills. Teachers thus have both the primary source (content) and instructional activities (skills) for use in the classroom. Chapter One presents a general introduction to historical sources.

Author: Christopher J. Lucas</p><h2>Fifty Famous Stories Retold (Illustrated Edition) (Dodo Press)</h2><p>James Baldwin (1841-1925) was an American editor and author. Largely self-educated, he began teaching at the age of 24. In addition to editing school books, he started writing books of his own. After the publication in 1882 of The Story of Siegfried, he went on to write more than 50 others. At one time it was estimated that of all the school books in use in the United States, over half had been written or edited by him. He is best remembered for the books of introductory historical sketches he wrote for younger students and his retellings of the legends of heroes for older students. Other works include: The Story of Roland (1883), A Story of the Golden Age (1887), Old Greek Stories (1895), Fifty Famous Stories Retold (1896), Four Great Americans (1897), Hero Tales (1904), Fifty Famous People (1912) and In My Youth (1914).</p><p>James Baldwin (1924-1987) burst on the literary scene in 1953 with his novel Go Tell It on the Mountain, which received excellent reviews and immediately was recognized as establishing a profound new voice in American letters. His acclaimed collection of essays, Notes of a Native Son, was published in 1955. A second collection of essays, Nobody Knows My Name, was published in 1961 between his novels Giovanni&#39;s Room (1956) and Another Country (1961).KING ALFRED AND THE CAKES <p>MANY years ago there lived in England a wise and good king whose name was Alfred. No other man ever did so much for his country as he; and people now, all over the world, speak of him as Alfred the Great. </p><p>In those days a king did not have a very easy life. There was war almost all the time, and no one else could lead his army into battle so well as he. And so, between ruling and fighting, he had a busy time of it indeed. </p><p>A fierce, rude people, called the Danes, had come from over the sea, and were fighting the English. There were so many of them, and they were so bold and strong, that for a long time they gained every battle. If they kept on, they would soon be the masters of the whole country. </p><p>At last, after a great battle, the English army was broken up and scattered. Every man had to save himself in the best way he could. King Alfred fled alone, in great haste, through the woods and swamps. </p><p>Late in the day the king came to the hut of a woodcutter. He was very tired and hungry, and he begged the woodcutter&#x2019;s wife to give him something to eat and a place to sleep in her hut. </p><p>The woman was baking some cakes upon the hearth, and she looked with pity upon the poor, ragged fellow who seemed so hungry. She had no thought that he was the king. </p><p>"Yes," she said, "I will give you some supper if you will watch these cakes. I want to go out and milk the cow; and you must see that they do not burn while I am gone." </p><p>King Alfred was very willing to watch the cakes, but he had far greater things to think about. How was he going to get his army together again? And how was he going to drive the fierce Danes out of the land? He forgot his hunger; he forgot the cakes; he forgot that he was in the woodcutter&#x2019;s hut. His mind was busy making plans for to-morrow. </p><p>In a little while the woman came back. The cakes were smoking on the hearth. They were burned to a crisp. Ah, how angry she was! </p><p>"You lazy fellow!" she cried. "See what you have done! You want something to eat, but you do not want to work!" </p><p>I have been told that she even struck the king with a stick; but I can hardly believe that she was so ill-natured. </p><p>The king must have laughed to himself at the thought of being scolded in this way; and he was so hungry that he did not mind the woman&#x2019;s angry words half so much as the loss of the cakes. </p><p>I do not know whether he had anything to eat that night, or whether he had to go to bed without his supper. But it was not many days until he had gathered his men together again, and had beaten the Danes in a great battle.</p></p><h2>Skeptical Essays</h2><p>"In philosophy," the author writes in&nbsp;his preface, "we have learned to get our satisfaction from showing that the other fellow is mistaken rather than from establishing the truth of our own positive tenets."

Drawing on sources that include records of charitable organizations, sociological studies, and numerous memoirs of formerly homeless persons, Kusmer demonstrates that the homeless have been a significant presence on the American scene for over two hundred years. He probes the history of homelessness from a variety of angles, showing why people become homeless; how charities and public authorities dealt with this social problem; and the diverse ways in which different class, ethnic, and racial groups perceived and responded to homelessness. Kusmer demonstrates that, despite the common perception of the homeless as a deviant group, they have always had much in common with the average American.<br>Focusing on the millions who suffered downward mobility, <em>Down and Out, On the Road</em> provides a unique view of the evolution of American society and raises disturbing questions about the repeated failure to face and solve the problem of homelessness.</p><p><br><strong>Kenneth L. Kusmer</strong> is Professor of History at Temple University.<br>Homelessness is not only a contemporary phenomenon in the U.S. according to this well-researched and engrossing history. While many readers will be familiar with the hobos and box-car riders of the 1920s and the post-Depression world of transient skid row inhabitants, Kusmer has uncovered a complex sociology that transforms how we view U.S. culture and history in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Kusmer examines overarching social conditions and structures such as a condemnatory U.S. Protestant work-ethic response to homelessness, and why "workhouse" solutions do not deal with underlying economic issues. The mythologies of the "tramp as criminal," "pedophile seducer" and disease carrier are examined and taken apart. But Kusmer is at his best when describing the specifics of people's lives, from "the wandering poor" and "sturdy beggars of Colonial times" to the creation of the "tramp" after the Civil War, the social position of penniless Jewish scholars on New York's Lower East Side in the 1890s, and the political ramifications of unemployment as manifested in Coxey's Army's 1894 march on Washington. Drawing upon sociological studies, reports from charitable institutions, the novels of William Dean Howell and Stephen Crane, and the music of blues writer and singer Ida Cox, Kusmer has produced a book that is highly engaging, emotionally absorbing, and historically consequential. (Dec.)Forecast: Unfortunately, homelessness is not likely to be a front-burner issue in the coming months, and the lack of substantive coverage of WWII and beyond further limits the book's contemporary reach. But its scholarly basis should make it a must for most campus libraries, particularly those strong in sociology and urban studies. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>How To Know The Wildflowers</h2><p>First published in 1893, this field guide offers the history, legends, and etymological derivations of various wildflowers</p><p></p><h2>The Norton Reader: An Anthology of Nonfiction Prose/Shorter</h2><p>Adopted at over 700 schools in its previous edition, <i>The Norton Reader</i> has long been the standard bearer for liberal arts composition readers.

Next to model formulation, this edition puts major emphasis on exploratory data analysis for all aspects of the model, such as the marginal model, subject-specific profiles, and residual covariance structure. Further, model diagnostics and missing data receive extensive treatment. Sensitivity analysis for incomplete data is given a prominent place. Several variations to the conventional linear mixed model are discussed (a heterogeity model, conditional linear mixed models). This book will be of interest to applied statisticians and biomedical researchers in industry, public health organizations, contract research organizations, and academia. The book is explanatory rather than mathematically rigorous. Most analyses were done with the MIXED procedure of the SAS software package, and many of its features are clearly elucidated. However, some other commercially available packages are discussed as well. Great care has been taken in presenting the data analyses in a software-independent fashion. </p> <p></p> <p>Geert Verbeke is Professor in Biostatistics at the Biostatistical Centre of the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven in Belgium.

Now it's shaking things up again as editor Walter Murch, director Anthony Minghella, and a long list of Hollywood heavy-hitters are proving that this under-$1,000 software can (and should) be used to edit a multi-million dollar motion picture! This book tells the story of that endeavor: the decision to use Final Cut Pro, the relationship between the technology and art (and craft) of movie-making, how Final Cut Pro was set up and configured for <i>Cold Mountain,</i> how the software's use affected the work flow, and its implications for the future of filmmaking. More than anything, however, this is Murch's own story of what seemed to many a crazy endeavor-- told through photos, journal entries, email musings, and anecdotes that give readers an inside view of what the film editor does and how this particular film progressed through post-production. The book includes, in his own words, Murch's vision, approach, and thoughts on storytelling as he shapes <i>Cold Mountain</i> under the intense pressures of completing a major studio film.</p> <p>With Academy Awards for his work on <i>Apocalypse Now</i> and <i>The English Patient</i>, sound and film editor Walter Murch is one of the few universally acknowledged editing masters in cinema. Along with George Lucas and Francis Ford Coppola, he is one of the founding members of the Northern California cinema community. Author <b>Charles Koppelman</b> has been writing screenplays and directing video and film since the early 1980s, including the independent feature film, <i>Dumbarton Bridge,</i> award-winning documentaries, and commercials.</p> <p> "An exploration inside the editorial engine-room of a major feature film - the first book of its kind ever and sure to remain the best. Charles Koppelman chronicles Walter Murch's astonishing high-wire trapeze act as he works his way through the first large-scale implementation of Apple's Final Cut Pro editing software. Must be read by anyone interested in film, computers, or how the creative process unfolds." -- Francis Ford Coppola, director of The Conversation, The Godfather, Apocalypse Now</p> <p> "This is probably the subtlest and most tender account of what a craftsman brings to a motion picture ever written. It is fascinating in its detail and awesome in its gradual uncovering of the ear, the eye and the soul of Walter Murch. The book may seem technical, or 'professional,' but any reader will be thrilled by the description of a struggle and the necessary commitment to it. To be read by anyone who has ever thought it might be fun to make a movie." -- David Thomson, film critic and author of The Biographical Dictionary</p> <p> "BEHIND THE SEEN is not only revelatory in terms of technical innovation, but it reads like a thrilling suspense novel. Superbly written and paced, the book captures the brilliant and daring film/sound editor-scientist Walter Murch in all his passionate and creative glory. Charles Koppelman has crafted a truly unique addition to the canon of film history, delivering a must-read for anyone interested in how movies are made." --Barry Gifford, author of Wild at Heart, Lost Highway and City of Ghosts</p> <p> "... excellent, original and tremendously informative book... Koppelman's account reads like a thriller... Behind the Seen achieves something remarkable: a chronicle about technology and data, machines and methodologies which also manages to record a story of friendships and dreams-not least the dreams I have been lucky enough to share with my friend and editor over three films and for almost a decade." --from the book's foreword by Anthony Minghella, writer and director of Cold Mountain, The English Patient, and The Talented Mr. Ripley</p></p><p><i>Cold Mountain</i>, the recent film based on the Charles Frazier novel, is a love story set during the American Civil War. <i>Behind the Seen</i>, being the story of how accomplished film editor Walter Murch (of <i>Apocalypse Now</i> fame), is also a story of love in a time of internal conflict. The difference being that <i>Behind the Seen</i> has to do with how Murch used Final Cut Pro, a software package that runs on any modern Macintosh and costs less than $1000, to edit <i>Cold Mountain</i> and thereby incite debate among professional film editors. Can such a mass-market product, accessible to anyone with a camcorder and a FireWire cable, be a serious tool for professionals? Murch proved that it can.<p> <i>Behind the Seen</i> deals with the technical accomplishment of using Final Cut Pro to assemble a feature film, but more importantly explains to its readers how shooting and editing work--and how the personalities involved in <i>Cold Mountain</i> worked together. This is a book of nonfiction that you can read from beginning to end; it is a technical book but not in the click-and-drag sense. Rather, it's a story about a creative team and the tools they used to deliver a work of drama. <i>--David Wall</i></p><p> <b>Topics covered</b>: How <i>Cold Mountain</i> was shot and edited, using Final Cut Pro as the principal editing suite.</p><p> With Academy Awards for his work on Apocalypse Now and The English Patient ,sound and film editor Walter Murch is one of the few universallyacknowledged editing masters in cinema.

The book&#39;s conclusion is as applicable today as it was when first published: &#34;More moral panics will be generated and other, as yet nameless, folk devils will be created ...our society as presently structured will continue to generate problems for some of its members - like working class adolescents - and then condemn whatever solution these groups find.&#34;</p><p>Stanely Cohen is a Professor at the London School of Economics.

It has proved consistently fertile for a great deal of new work in sociological analysis the thirty years since its first publication and its critical idea of moral panics proved to be generative for a wide variety of scholars and research fields.

After a fortuitous meeting with the financier, philanthropist, and art collector B. Gerald Cantor, Elsen helped Cantor build a major collection of Rodin's work. A large part of this collection, consisting of more than two hundred works, was donated to the Stanford University's museum by Mr. Cantor, who died in 1996. In size Stanford's collection is surpassed only by the Mus�e Rodin in Paris and rivaled only by the collection in Philadelphia.

As an active fan of the genres, he was a member of the Society for Creative Anachronism, a co-founder of the Great Dark Horde, and founder of the Dorsai Irregulars. He was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Dramtic Presentation for The Capture in 1976. Asprin died in 2008 at the age of 61 having published over fifty novels and several short stories.Behind the puerile punning names and extraterrestrial setting stands a modest, winning story about a commander who builds a company of misfits, rejects and even a few aliens into a disciplined military outfit. Tricked into taking on the worst detachment in a far outpost of the Space Legion, Captain Willard Phule uses every resource in his control, particularly his immense wealth and his knowledge of how to motivate and lead people, to whip his skeptical crew of strays into shape and make them feel that they have, at last, found a home. This lighthearted tale is part science fiction, part spoof, part heart-warmer, its farcical elements pitted against the proper, stuffy voice of Phule's butler, Beeker, whose wry commentary precedes each section of narrative. Phule rings true as an astute entrepreneur of the human (and nonhuman) spirit. The psychological acumen that colors Asprin's characterizations, Phule in particular, gives the book the verisimilitude that is the essence of successful science fiction. Asprin wrote the Myth series. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Carmilla</h2><p>Following a near fatal carriage collision, the beautiful young Carmilla is taken in by the narrator Laura and her father. The two young women become strangely attracted to each other, but there seems to be more to Carmilla than meets the eye.

He takes up subjects ranging from the philosophical to the practical-what mathematics is and why it&#39;s worth doing, the relationship between logic and proof, the role of beauty in mathematical thinking, the future of mathematics, how to deal with the peculiarities of the mathematical community, and many others.</p><p><b>Ian Stewart</b> is Professor of Mathematics at the University of Warwick and is well known for his writing and broadcasting about mathematics for nonspecialists. He has written over 140 research papers on such subjects as symmetry in dynamics, pattern formation, chaos, and mathematical biology, as well as numerous popular books, including <i>Letters to a Young Mathematician</i>, <i>Does God Play Dice?</i>, <i>What Shape Is a Snowflake?</i>, <i>Nature's Numbers</i>, <i>The Annotated Flatland</i>, and <i>Flatterland</i>. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 2001. He lives in Coventry, England.<i>Starred Review.</i> This new entry in the Art of Mentoring series takes the form of letters from a fictitious mathematician to his niece. The letters span a period of 20 years, from the time the niece is thinking about studying mathematics in high school through the early years of her academic career. The format works wonderfully to introduce readers to the basics of the discipline of mathematics while providing a sense of what mathematicians actually do. Throughout, the prolific and talented Stewart (<i>Does God Play Dice?</i>), a British mathematician, entertains while educating. He explains how mathematics is so much more than mere calculations and how it's used in almost every facet of our lives. He also discusses the beauty mathematicians can find in the natural world, demonstrating that a focus on numbers and patterns can enhance rather than detract from an aesthetic appreciation of the environment. Stewart also does a superb job of examining the nature and value of both applied research and pure research, which, he shows, are not nearly as disparate as many think. Although the book must be read by anyone thinking about a career in mathematics, others simply interested in learning about the field and how mathematicians think will find it compelling reading. <i>(Apr. 17)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Feldman&#x2019;s <i>Essentials of Understanding Psychology</i> does. <br><br> <b>Using a revolutionary revision process</b>, Bob Feldman&#x2019;s <i>Essentials of Understanding Psychology</i> is a fully integrated learning system that gives students an even greater opportunity to achieve success, and brings the <b>Students First</b> goal to a new level. With an <b>adaptive learning system</b> that provides an individualized learning environment and helps students identify what they know, and more importantly, what they don&#x2019;t, every student has a unique experience refined to their needs.<br><br> The thoroughly revised Tenth Edition is a first of its kind, revised using <b>&#x201c;HeatMap&#x201d;</b> technology in which systematic and precise feedback from thousands of students was anonymously measured using LearnSmart, the adaptive learning diagnostic. Because virtually every paragraph in the previous edition is tied to several questions students answer in LearnSmart, Bob was able to see where students struggled most...the <b>&#x201c;hot spots&#x201d;</b>...and in turn refine and update these areas to be more clear, more concise, and more impactful. <br><br> The 10th edition continues Bob Feldman&#x2019;s <b>accessible pedagogy and hallmark research,</b> as well as his <b>modules-within-chapters format</b> that is both manageable for students and allows every professor the flexibility to assign and cover what they want. The <b>4 additional modules in CREATE</b> give instructors even extra flexibility to completely cater their text to their course and their students.</p><p>Robert S. Feldman still remembers those moments of being overwhelmed when he started college at Wesleyan University. &#x201c;I wondered whether I was up to the challenges that faced me,&#x201d; he recalls, &#x201c;and--although I never would have admitted it at the time--I really had no idea what it took to be successful at college.&#x201d; That experience, along with his encounters with many students during his own teaching career, led to a life-long interest in helping students navigate the critical transition that they face at the start of their own college careers. Professor Feldman, who went on to receive a doctorate in psychology from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, teaches at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, where he is Associate Dean of the College of Social and Behavioral Sciences and Professor of Psychology. He directs POWER Up for Student Success, the UMass first-year experience course for incoming students. Professor Feldman&#x2019;s proudest professional accomplishment is winning the College Outstanding Teaching Award at UMass. He also has been named a Hewlett Teaching Fellow and was Senior Online Instruction Fellow. He has taught courses at Mount Holyoke College, Wesleyan University, and Virginia Commonwealth University. Professor Feldman is a Fellow of both the American Psychological Association and the Association for Psychological Science. He is a winner of a Fulbright Senior Research Scholar and Lecturer award and has written some 100 scientific articles, book chapters, and books. His books, some of which have been translated into Spanish, French, Portuguese, and Chinese, include Improving the First Year of College: Research and Practice, Understanding Psychology, 8/e, and Development Across the Life Span, 4/e. His research interests encompass the study of honesty and truthfulness in everyday life, development of nonverbal behavior in children, and the social psychology of education. His research has been supported by grants from the National Institute of Mental Health and the National Institute on Disabilities and Rehabilitation Research. With the last of his three children completing college, Professor Feldman occupies his spare time with serious cooking and earnest, but admittedly unpolished, piano playing. He also loves to travel. He lives with his wife, who is an educational psychologist, in a home overlooking the Holyoke mountain range in western Massachusetts.</p><h2>Ethical Decisions for Social Work Practice</h2><p>This classic social work text helps students recognize ethical issues and dilemmas, reason carefully about ethical issues, clarify their ethical aspirations at the level demanded by the profession, and achieve a more ethical stance in their practice.

The authors have assembled theoretical explanations and treatment systems based on the use of the eight extraordinary vessels. The information comes from highly successful Oriental scholars and practitioners. The reasoning and research from which these treatment systems are derived is detailed, beginning with the classical descriptions of these vessels as the oceans of qi and blood. <p>Descriptions of the eight trajectories include starting points, pathways, variant pathways, and branches. Eleven full-page body charts illuminate the text and more than 50 tables summarize the trajectories, the meeting points, and the areas of diagnostic correspondence. Classical extra meridian treatments are set out, with treatment styles that are detailed in step-by-step presentations. Fascinating systems that have been only partially or superficially reported in the West are fully explained. These systems include plus-minus needling, the Chinese system of body zones, the use of bipolar metals, magnets, and electrically pulsed magnets. Sample treatments, illustrations of correspondence and reflex areas, treatment tables, and diagrams provide practical support. There is a major treatment list for the eight master-coupled points, with thousands of indications for the points from Japanese, Chinese, English, and German texts. Organized by body area or specific condition, this reference permits the practitioner to see how the various indications relate to one another and form groups. A final section describes the authors' experience in combining extraordinary vessel and magnetic treatments with element/stem diagnosis, scar treatment, and zone therapy.</p></p><p>The authors&#39; attempted for the first time in English, a compilation of the major historical literature on the eight extraordinary vessels. The first chapter introduces the basic theoretical model of the extraordinary vessels with some modern extrapolations. The second chapter contains the most comprehensive compilation of all the major historical discussions of the pathways of the extraordinary vessels that can be found in English. The third chapter contains a compilation of the most comprehensive Asian discussions of the indications and treatment targets for the extraordinary vessels from the historical literature in English. The fourth chapter introduces two rather unique modern uses of the extraordinary vessels developed in Japan. The final sections attempt to show parallels between the historical literature and the modern uses, specially TCM. Recently, other texts on the extraordinary vessels have been published, but none have attempted to report in depth from on the historical literature that this text features.".this is an excellent book to be highly recommended to any acupuncture practitioner." -- <i>Giovanni Maciocia, in a letter to the Journal of Traditional Acupuncture</i><br><br>"It is a delight to see that there is a return to the original concepts of acupuncture and the movement of energy on a global level, as distinct from the use of points purely for the removal of specific perverse influences." -- <i>British Journal of Acupuncture</i></p><h2>History of Art for Young People 6/e</h2><p>For 40 years this widely praised work has remained unsurpassed as an introduction to art in the Western world.

This book has vigor, courage, practicality and lucidity, but above all, it has wisdom. I know of no psychotherapist who would not be enriched by reading it. &#x2015;Irvin D. Yalom, M.D., professor of psychiatry, Stanford University School of Medicine&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Irvin D, Yalom, M.D.</strong><br><br>&#x201c;James Bugental is not only a born therapist but also one who seeks indefatigably to learn more about the inner aspects of therapy. I think he is entirely right that the subjective area is the locale for improving the project of therapy. This book is a log of what he has learned.

Today she is acclaimed as one of the world's most distinguished botanical artists. Stones served for twenty-five years as the principal illustrator for Curtis's Botanical Magazine, contributing more than 400 drawings. She has also completed a six-volume illustrated work, The Endemic Flora of Tasmania, and has worked under commission for the Royal Botanical Gardens at Kew, England, the Royal Horticultural Society of England, and similar institutions the world over.In 1976, as part of the United States' bicentennial celebration, Louisiana State University commissioned Stones to execute six watercolor renderings of Louisiana flora. This initial project was so successful that Stones was asked to draw a much larger number of the state's native plants. Today Stones has completed more than 200 watercolors, all of which are maintained in the LSU Libraries' E. A. McIlhenny Natural History Collection. The drawings represent not only a collection of exquisite botanical art but an accurate scientific record of Louisiana's lush, varied, and beautiful flora.Flora of Louisiana reproduces the great bulk of Stones's collection. The volume contains more than 200 pages of full-color and black-and-white illustrations. Each drawing is accompanied by a short text that gives information about the plant, including a physical description and details about habitat and growing conditions.The publications of Flora of Louisiana is set to coincide with the first of several international exhibitions of Stones's drawings, beginning in April, 1991.</p></p><p>Flora of Louisiana reproduces the great bulk of Stone&#39;s collection.

His work has been featured on national television and radio, including <i>Oprah</i>, GMA, NPR, and Larry King, among others.Behind the Gates of Gomorrah PREFACE<p></p> <br>Raymond Boudreaux and I sat at opposite ends of a rickety wooden table&#x2014;with him nearest to the door. This was a mistake.<br> <br>Two fluorescent ceiling tubes lit the cramped space, and the walls were war-surplus beige. A single small window in the door looked out into a hallway.<br> <br>The July air hung musty and still. My chair made a tiny screech against the chipped linoleum floor as I slid it forward.<br> <br>&#x201c;Mr. Boudreaux, good afternoon,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Dr. Seager.&#x201d;<br> <br>Boudreaux didn&#x2019;t reply. Clad in robin&#x2019;s-egg-blue hospital scrubs, he was a hulking black man with shoulders wide as goalposts. I felt fixed in his gaze.<br> <br>&#x201c;Mr. Boudreaux&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?&#x201d; I tried again. Boudreaux&#x2019;s eyes didn&#x2019;t waver. I shifted uncomfortably, wondering how long someone could actually go without blinking.<br> <br>A psychiatrist, I&#x2019;d recently been hired to run an inpatient unit at a large state forensic mental hospital. It was the kind of dangerous, unsettling place made familiar by the fictitious Baltimore State in The Silence of the Lambs. After a week of training, Raymond Boudreaux was the first patient I&#x2019;d talked to alone. I was rushing to get home. It was late, and the room had been convenient.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m your new doctor,&#x201d; I persisted. &#x201c;How are you feeling, sir?&#x201d;<br> <br>Another pause. Then Boudreaux&#x2019;s impassive face changed. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re a bloodsucker, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; He smiled, his Creole-tinged voice smooth as glass. He tipped his head and studied me like a curious dog. His eyes narrowed. My heart leaped.<br> <br>A forensic mental hospital isn&#x2019;t like a regular mental hospital. The patients aren&#x2019;t just psychotic. They&#x2019;re also criminals. They&#x2019;re the school shooters, James Holmeses, and Jeffrey Dahmers of the world. I&#x2019;d seen Raymond Boudreaux on CNN when he was first arrested.<br> <br>Boudreaux&#x2019;s breathing accelerated. &#x201c;You and that fucking district attorney,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re both in this together. I know your kind. You&#x2019;ll beat a man to death, then suck the blood out of his corpse.&#x201d;<br> <br>Boudreaux, a New Orleans native, had graduated from Yale with an MBA. He&#x2019;d worked in management for a bank in San Francisco. Then he became ill. A month after his termination, he killed his boss and several coworkers with a shotgun.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to strangle that faggot DA,&#x201d; Boudreaux snarled as he stood. &#x201c;Or you.&#x201d; His massive frame partially obscured the door and I became acutely aware of the seating error. Panicked, I stood as well.<br> <br>With hands as large as skillets, Boudreaux grabbed the edges of the table and pushed it forward, pinning my thighs to the wall. My chair clattered to the floor. I looked frantically toward the small window into the hallway but saw nothing. I reached for the belt alarm we&#x2019;d been issued for situations like this and remembered that it was still in my office.<br> <br>Sweat rolled off the crest of Boudreaux&#x2019;s shaven head. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t move, you son of a bitch,&#x201d; he seethed, and pushed the table harder.<br> <br>Amid the terrified jumble in my head, an old piece of advice appeared: &#x201c;If you&#x2019;re ever cornered by an angry patient,&#x201d; a medical school instructor had once told me, &#x201c;keep talking.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Tell me about your crime.&#x201d;<br> <br>The veins in Boudreaux&#x2019;s neck bulged and his eyes widened. The table hit bone in my legs. He took a couple of choppy breaths, and then the pressure on my legs waned. Boudreaux&#x2019;s head dropped and his stare softened.<br> <br>He let go of the table, sat back down, and put a hand on his forehead. He looked smaller. He looked mortal.<br> <br>&#x201c;I killed my closest friends,&#x201d; Boudreaux said slowly. &#x201c;What kind of a person does that?&#x201d;<br> <br>I edged out from behind the table.<br> <br>&#x201c;A person with an illness does that,&#x201d; I said, sidling toward the door. I reached around a slumped Boudreaux and grabbed the door handle. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s why you&#x2019;re here and not in prison. You&#x2019;re not bad, you&#x2019;re sick.&#x201d;<br> <br>Opening the door, I glanced down the long hallway and hurriedly waved toward Lola Palanqui, a unit nurse, and two strapping psych techs, who hustled toward me. My legs began to tremble, but I managed to turn back to Boudreaux.<br> <br>&#x201c;Will you be okay?&#x201d;<br> <br>Boudreaux said nothing.<br> <br>&#x201c;The staff will help you back to your room,&#x201d; I said, and stumbled aside as the cavalry arrived.<br> <br>The two techs escorted Boudreaux back down the hall.<br> <br>Dark hair, thirties, Palanqui stood before me with her hands on her hips. We were nearly toe-to-toe. For the second time, I&#x2019;d been backed against a wall. Although I grimaced in pain, she glared up at me.<br> <br>&#x201c;Were you in there alone with Mr. Boudreaux?&#x201d; Palanqui asked in Tagalog-accented English.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t they tell you not to do that?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He could have killed you.&#x201d;<br> <br>I caught a breath. &#x201c;I know. It was really fright&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t you learn anything from that terrible first day?&#x201d; she said.<br> <br>I touched the stitches in the back of my head. &#x201c;I just thought&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br> <br>I didn&#x2019;t know what to say.<br> <br>&#x201c;We need you, Doc,&#x201d; Palanqui said, and touched my arm. &#x201c;Please get smarter.&#x201d;<br> <br>I sank to the floor. I&#x2019;d taken the state hospital job thinking I could help. But I was on my way to getting myself or someone else killed.<br> <br>Boudreaux called from the end of the hallway. He was walking to dinner with the rest of the patients.<br> <br>&#x201c;Thanks, Doc,&#x201d; he said with a wave.</p><h2>Quantitative Methods for Business (with Printed Access Card)</h2><p>You don&#39;t need to be a mathematician to understand and maximize the power of quantitative methods!

She did post-graduate study in Developmental Psychology at the University of Minnesota on a Fulbright Scholarship and completed her doctorate at the University of Auckland with a thesis entitled &#34;Emergent Literacy.&#34; Her &#39;Reading (and writing) Recovery&#39; is an early literacy intervention, which is now implemented in five countries, and three languages. Literacy Lessons Designed For Individuals integrates what has been learned from that innovation with new research and theoretical advocacies. Shifts in early literacy learning can be monitored by teachers using her Observation Survey of Early Literacy Achievement in English, Spanish and French. A series of individual lessons can be delivered in those languages to about 150,000 children worldwide annually using a guidebook called Reading Recovery: Guidelines for Teachers in Training. Literacy Lessons Designed for Individuals is a similar guidebook which aims to make accelerated progress possible for a wider range of problems.

With the breakup of his marriage that year, rumors of a scandalous relationship he may have conducted with the young actress Ellen "Nelly" Ternan flourished. For the remaining twelve years of his life, Dickens managed to contain the gossip. After his death, surviving family members did the same. But when the author's last living son died in 1934, there was no one to discourage rampant speculation. Dramatic revelations came from every corner&#x2014;over Nelly's role as Dickens's mistress, their clandestine meetings, and even about his possibly fathering an illegitimate child by her.</p><p>This book presents the most complete account of the scandal and ensuing cover-up ever published. Drawing on the author's letters and other archival sources not previously available, Dickens scholar Michael Slater investigates what Dickens did or may have done, then traces the way the scandal was elaborated over succeeding generations. Slater shows how various writers concocted outlandish yet plausible theories while newspapers and book publishers vied for sensational revelations. With its tale of intrigue and a&nbsp;cast of well-known figures from Thackeray and Shaw to Orwell and Edmund Wilson, this engaging book will delight not only Dickens fans but also readers who appreciate tales of mystery, cover-up, and clever detection.</p></p><p><p><b>Michael Slater</b> is emeritus professor of Victorian literature at Birkbeck College, University of London; past president of the International Dickens Fellowship and of the Dickens Society of America; and author of <i>Charles Dickens</i>.

Caseworkers often go into the worst situations and have insufficient time to make effective interventions. By applying the principles of brief, solution-focused therapy to family-based services, social service workers can deliver treatment that is cost-effective, humane, and empowering to families. For professionals unfamiliar with the theory and concepts of brief therapy, Berg describes the process in a step-by-step fashion. She gives clear guidelines on what to cover in assessment interviews, how to talk to clients so they will listen to you and feel heard by you, how to conduct yourself in a client&#39;s home, what to do about dangerous situations, and how a solution-focused approach can be adapted to a variety of service programs. Case examples illustrate different techniques, and sample assessment forms are included, which can be adapted to different agency needs. Workers can engage clients in productive problem solving by concentrating on what clients do right, rather than what they do wrong. With this book in hand, workers have a useful tool for empowering families.Insoo Kim Berg, MSW, codeveloped Solution-Focused Brief Therapy and is Director of the Brief Family Therapy Center in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

From its inception as a &#x201c;poor house&#x201d; dispensing free medical care to indigents, Chicago&#x2019;s Cook County Hospital has been both a renowned teaching hospital and the health care provider of last resort for the city&#x2019;s uninsured.&nbsp;<i>County</i>&nbsp;covers more than thirty years of its history, beginning in the late 1970s when the author began his internship, to the &#x201c;final rounds&#x201d; in 2002, when hundreds of former trainees and personnel, many of whom shared Ansell's vision of resurrecting a hospital in critical condition, gathered to bid the &nbsp;iconic Victorian hospital building an emotional farewell before it was closed to make way for a new facility.<i>County</i>&nbsp;is about people--from Ansell&#x2019;s mentors, including the legendary Quentin Young, to the multitude of patients whom he and County&#x2019;s medical staff labored to diagnose and heal. It is a story about politics; from contentious union strikes, to battles against &#x201c;patient dumping.&#x201d; Most importantly, it chronicles the battles for instigating new programs that would help to prevent, rather than just treat, serious illnesses, including the opening of County&#x2019;s HIV/AIDS clinic (the first in the city), as well as an early-detection breast cancer screening program.

Completed in 1913 after ten years of construction, the terminal became the city's most important transportation hub, linking long-distance and commuter trains to New York's network of subways, elevated trains, and streetcars. Its soaring Grand Concourse still offers passengers a majestic gateway to the wonders beyond 42nd Street.</p><p>In <i>Grand Central Terminal,</i> Kurt C. Schlichting traces the history of this spectacular building, detailing the colorful personalities, bitter conflicts, and Herculean feats of engineering that lie behind its construction. Schlichting begins with Cornelius Vanderbilt&#x2015;"The Commodore"&#x2015;whose railroad empire demanded an appropriately palatial passenger terminal in the heart of New York City. Completed in 1871, the first Grand Central was the largest rail facility in the world and yet&#x2015;cramped and overburdened&#x2015;soon proved thoroughly inadequate for the needs of this rapidly expanding city. William Wilgus, chief engineer of the New York Central Railroad, conceived of a new Grand Central Terminal, one that would fully meet the needs of the New York Central line. Grand Central became a monument to the creativity and daring of a remarkable age.</p><p>The terminal's construction proved to be a massive undertaking. Before construction could begin, more than 3 million cubic yards of rock and earth had to be removed and some 200 buildings demolished. Manhattan's exorbitant real estate prices necessitated a vast, two-story underground train yard, which in turn required a new, smoke-free electrified rail system. The project consumed nearly 30,000 tons of steel, three times more than that in the Eiffel Tower, and two power plants were built. The terminal building alone cost $43 million in 1913, the equivalent of nearly $750 million today.</p><p>Some of these costs were offset by an ambitious redevelopment project on property above the New York Central's underground tracks. Schlichting writes about the economic and cultural impact of the terminal on midtown Manhattan, from building of the Biltmore and Waldorf-Astoria Hotels to the transformation of Park Avenue. Schlichting concludes with an account of the New York Central's decline; the public outcry that prevented Grand Central's new owner, Penn Central, from following through with its 1969 plan to demolish or drastically alter the terminal; the rise of Metro-North Railroad; and the meticulous 1990s restoration project that returned Grand Central Terminal to its original splendor. More than a history of a train station, this book is the story of a city and an age as reflected in a building aptly described as a secular cathedral.</p></p><p><p>More than a history of a train station&#x2015;the story of a city and an age, as reflected in a building aptly described as a secular cathedral.</p><p><b>Kurt C.

The first of these, <i>Village School</i>, was published in 1955, and Miss Read continued to write until her retirement in 1996. In the 1998, she was awarded an MBE, or Member of the Order of the British Empire, for her services to literature.&nbsp;</p>The chronicles of village life in rural England, filled with truisms and seasonal detail, soothe the listener and recall a quieter, and kinder, time and place. June Barrie has narrated many of these charming books and here pays tribute to the older women of the village with the kindness that the author feels for each one. Her voice is perfect for the gentleness of the narrative. Barrie is as competent with the speaking males as she is with every other aspect of Thrush Green. These books are generous in their understanding of the world and the foibles of mankind. Nothing earth-shattering happens, but everything carries the drama and wisdom of lives led in close society. The listener is transported to Thrush Green. B.H.B.

The authors address the importance of reinterpreting historical works by known homosexual photographers, issues in contemporary photography and sexual diversity, and the use and abuse of photographs of sexual subjects in current political campaigns and direct activism. <em>The Passionate Camera</em> features color and black and white illustrations of works by artists such as Ajamu, Catherine Opie, Lyle Ashton, Yasumasa Morimura, John O'Reilly and Sunil Gupta. For the first time, these works have been gathered together in a lucid and accessible critical context, making <em>The Passionate Camera</em> the pre-eminent source on queer and sex-radical photography at the end of the twentieth century.</p><p>Deborah Bright is Associate Professor of Photography and Art History at the Rhode Island School of Design."The Passionate Camera is fairly equally oriented toward queer male and female imagery."<br>-Feminist Bookstore News, Januanry/February 1999 <br>"The "Passionate Camera provides vibrant, rigorous and pleasurable readings of sex work in the practice of photography and the filed of photographic criticism of recent years..It is Bright's role as creative and shrewd editor that makes "The Passionate Camera such an exceptional volume. The book has an inner consistency that is uncommon in anthologies; the different essays flow into one another in a productive and lyrical manner. The three sections are metered by provocative photo essays and end with pointed short stories by artist and writer Catherine Lord."<br>-"afterimage, March/April 1999 <br>""The Passionate Camera . . . departs from the stale formula of academic publishing and provides vibrant, rigorous and pleasurable readings of sex work in the practice of photography and the field of photographic criticism of recent years . . . [Bright's] extraordinary introduction to the volume succeeds in its formidable task of making sense of the past 15 years of photography and queer cultural politics. . . . and through this furthers the emergence of queer studies in academia . . . . "The Passionate Camera will surely be widely used as an indespensible theoretical and historical document on queer visual culture at the end of the millennium. It has endless potential as a course textbook and library resource. The contributors' confident and committed collective gaze rests on a troubled past and on an unsettling present, but they all reassert the besieged queer body of desire into the future."<br>-Afterimage, March 1999 <br>"The success of this newanthology of images and texts derives from the fact that Deborah Bright is equally gifted as an artist, a teacher, and critical theorist. The cumulative insights of "The Passionate Camera are both vibrantly comprehensive and intensely personal; these multi-disciplinary studies map radical approaches to the pungent complexities of photographs that are sexually charged."<br>-Trevor Fairbrother, Deputy Director of Art, Seattle Art Museum <br>"While engaging the challenge queer politics presents to the status quo, the contributions to "The Passionate Camera illuminate the central position that supposed minorities of all kinds hold in contemporary culture.

Giroux is one of the most respected and well-known critical education scholars, social critics, and astute observers of popular culture in the modern world. For those who follow his considerably influential work in critical pedagogy and social criticism, this first-ever collection of his classic writings, augmented by a new essay, is a must-have volume that reveals his evolution as a scholar. In it, he takes on three major considerations central to pedagogy and schooling.The first section offers Giroux&#39;s most widely read theoretical critiques on the culture of positivism and technocratic rationality. He contends that by emphasizing the logic of science and rationality rather than taking a holistic worldview, these approaches fail to take account of connections among social, political, and historical forces or to consider the importance of such connections for the process of schooling.In the second section, Giroux expands the theoretical framework for conceptualizing and implementing his version of critical pedagogy. His theory of border pedagogy advocates a democratic public philosophy that embraces the notion of difference as part of a common struggle to extend the quality of public life. For Giroux, a student must function as a border-crosser, as a person moving in and out of physical, cultural, and social borders. He uses the popular medium of Hollywood film to show students how they might understand their own position as partly constructed within a dominant Eurocentric tradition and how power and authority relate to the wider society as well as to the classroom.In the last section, Giroux explores a number of contemporary traditions and issues, including modernism, postmodernism, and feminism, and discusses the matter of cultural difference in the classroom. Finally, in an essay written especially for this volume, Giroux analyzes the assault on education and teachers as public intellectuals that began in the Reagan-Bush era and continues today.</p><p><b>Henry A.

Using this famed cemetery as symbolic starting point, <em>Buried Glory</em> profiles a dozen eminent Soviet scientists-nine of whom are buried at Novodevichy-men who illustrate both the glorious heights of Soviet research as well as the eclipse of science since the collapse of the USSR.<br><br>Drawing on extensive archival research and his own personal memories, renowned chemist Istvan Hargittai bring these figures back to life, placing their remarkable scientific achievements against the tense political backdrop of the Cold War. Among the eminent scientists profiled here are Petr L. Kapitza, one of the most brilliant representatives of the great generation of Soviet physicists, a Nobel-Prize winner who risked his career-and his life-standing up for fellow scientists against Stalin. Yulii B. Khariton, who ran the highly secretive Soviet nuclear weapons laboratory, Arzamas-16, despite being Jewish and despite the fact that his father Boris had been sent to the labor camps. And Andrei D. Sakharov, the "father of the Soviet hydrogen bomb" and a brilliant fighter for human rights, for which he won the Nobel Peace Prize. Along the way, Hargittai shines a light on the harrowing conditions under which these brilliant researchers excelled. Indeed, in the post-war period, Stalin's anti-Semitism and ongoing anti-science measures devastated biology, damaged chemistry, and nearly destroyed physics. The latter was saved only because Stalin realized that without physics and physicists there could be no nuclear weapons.<br><br>The extraordinary scientific talent nurtured by the Soviet regime belongs almost entirely to the past. <em>Buried Glory</em> is both a fitting tribute to these great scientists and a fascinating account of scientific work behind the Iron Curtain.<br></p><p><br><strong>Istvan Hargittai</strong> is a University Professor at the Institute of General and Analytical Chemistry, Budapest Technical University.

This outcome, that conclusion. You get my drift. The uncertainty is what holds the story together, and that's what I'm going to talk about."&#x2015;<i>Rhythm Science</i></p><p>The conceptual artist Paul Miller, also known as Dj Spooky that Subliminal Kid, delivers a manifesto for rhythm science&#x2015;the creation of art from the flow of patterns in sound and culture, "the changing same." Taking the Dj's mix as template, he describes how the artist, navigating the innumerable ways to arrange the mix of cultural ideas and objects that bombard us, uses technology and art to create something new and expressive and endlessly variable. Technology provides the method and model; information on the web, like the elements of a mix, doesn't stay in one place. And technology is the medium, bridging the artist's consciousness and the outside world.</p><p>Miller constructed his Dj Spooky persona ("spooky" from the eerie sounds of hip-hop, techno, ambient, and the other music that he plays) as a conceptual art project, but then came to see it as the opportunity for "coding a generative syntax for new languages of creativity." For example: "Start with the inspiration of George Herriman's Krazy Kat comic strip. Make a track invoking his absurd landscapes...What do tons and tons of air pressure moving in the atmosphere sound like? Make music that acts a metaphor for that kind of immersion or density." Or, for an online "remix" of two works by Marcel Duchamp: "I took a lot of his material written on music and flipped it into a DJ mix of his visual material&#x2015;with him rhyming!"

From its remarkable velvet flesh cover, to the die cut hole through the center of the book, which reveals the colored nub holding in place the included audio CD, <i>Rhythm Science: Excerpts and Allegories from the Sub Rosa Archives</i>, this pamphlet truly lives up to Editorial Director Peter Lunenfeld's claim that the Mediawork Pamphlets are "theoretical fetish objects...'zines for grown-ups."</p></p><p>"Once again, Paul Miller has pushed the sonic arts and sciences to a new level, and in the process re-mastered literary form.

Now, eight years later, a girl who looks like Julie shows up on their doorstep, similar in many ways to the daughter they loved and in other ways completely different. Is it really Julie? Amy Gentry doesn&#x2019;t pull her emotional punches as the chapters oscillate between maybe-Julie and Anna, and it&#x2019;s soon clear that the truth is not what it seems. But the truth might not be what <em>you</em> think it is either.

She has published twelve nonfiction works, including Bliss: Writing to Find Your True Self, and recently released Forensic Science of CSI and Cemetery Stories. She lives in Princeton, New Jersey.An extremely informative, very useful guide to understanding and writing about forensic psychology. Many writers, the author suggests, write about forensic psychologists without really appreciating what they do or how they do it. The author cites numerous examples from fiction to illustrate her points, showing how Thomas Harris made things seem a little too slick in <i>The Silence of the Lambs</i> or how James Patterson misunderstood some fundamentals in <i>Along Came a Spider.</i> She also uses several well-known cases histories--Charles Starkweather, Lizzie Borden, Dan White--to illustrate various psychological disorders and their diagnoses. Aspiring thriller writers should pay particular attention to the discussion of the relationship between psychology and the law, including the nature of insanity defenses and the treatment of offenders. Ramsland's mixture of fact and fiction is extremely helpful: she begins a discussion with something we recognize, like an episode from <i>Law &amp; Order, </i> and then segues gently into more unfamiliar territory. The book gives budding writers, and anyone else with an interest in this subject, a solid grounding in the history, terminology, and techniques of forensic psychology. <i>David Pitt</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Markets are now spreading worldwide-a spread which is often equated with the hope of democracy spreading along with it. But markets still run on old textbook models that ignore social and environmental costs-leading to a new kind of warfare: global economic warfare.<br> Building a Win-Win World demonstrates how the global economy is unsustainable because of its negative effects on employees, families, communities, and the ecosystem. Henderson shows that win-win strategies can become the norm at every level when people see the true current and future costs of short-sighted, narrow economic policies.<br> Henderson shows how humans are encountering the endgames of the competition/conflict paradigm, and identifies the signs of transition. Using warfare as a metaphor for the dark side of today's world economic system, she shows how both are destructive, inhumane, wasteful, irrational, inefficient, competitive, and crisis-driven. Both create more new problems than they solve. She describes how the globalization of the war system, technology, and industrialization brought the Cold War to a dead end. By the mid-1980s the global warfare paradigm had given ground to a global economic warfare which many economists, politicians, and business leaders hailed as a victory of capitalism and competitive "free markets." Yet this new type of warfare proved little better than the military warfare it was advertised to replace. By the mid-1990s global economic warfare had already reached crisis points of its own.<br> Building a Win-Win World examines how jobs, education, health care, human rights, democratic participation, socially responsible business, and environmental protection are all sacrificed to "global competitiveness." Henderson shows many ways out of the dilemmas faced by all countries. New agreements are described to tame the global economic casino, regulate multi-national corporations, and levy fees for commercial use of global common resources-oceans, atmosphere, space, etc.-and tax their abuse. These revenues can then be invested in civilian needs and sectors worldwide. She also describes a trend toward "grassroots globalism"-citizens movements that are addressing poverty, social inequities, pollution, resource-depletion, violence, and wars. Grassroots globalism, she says, is about thinking and acting-globally and locally. It is pragmatic problem-solving, implementing local solutions that keep the planet in mind. Such social innovations can raise the ethical floor under the global playing field so that the most ethical companies and countries can win.</p><p>World-renowned futurist Hazel Henderson extends her twenty-five years of work in economics to examine the havoc the current economic system is creating at the global level.

It is the first textbook of this kind to provide substantive treatment of more recent developments in logic.</p><p>Logic is a one-word description of the multitude of systems this book employs to teach the application of logic - from classical propositional and predicate logics to such alternatives as higher-order, modal, deontic, and non-classical logics. In presenting the formal and philosophical aspects of these various logics, this book provides you with a solid education in the considerations in logic. Moving from the basics of formal logic to more advanced topics, Logics uses concrete problems to introduce each system and proceeds to an account of the system&#39;s semantics. The book&#39;s detailed, carefully paced exposition guides you step-by-step through the complex structure of syntax, semantics, and metatheory, ultimately, allowing you to better understand logic and its applications.Preface.

It can also be used as a self-study or reference book by practicing researchers in signal analysis and related areas. Since the expected audience is not presumed to have a high level of mathematical background, much of the needed analytical machinery is developed from the beginning. The only prerequisites for the first eight chapters are matrix theory, Fourier series, and Fourier integral transforms. Each of these chapters ends with a set of straightforward exercises designed to drive home the concepts just covered, and the many graphics should further facilitate absorption.</p></p><p><p><i>I wholeheartedly recommend this book for a solid and friendly introduction to wavelets, for anyone who is comfortable with the mathematics required of undergraduate electrical engineers. The book's appeal is that it covers all the fundamental concepts of wavelets in an elegant, straightforward way. It offers truly enjoyable (friendly!) mathematical exposition that is rich in intuitive explanations, as well as clean, direct, and clear in its theoretical developments. I found Kaiser's straightforward end-of-chapter exercises excellent...Kaiser has written an excellent introduction to the fundamental concepts of wavelets. For a book of its length and purpose, I think it should be essentially unbeatable for a long time.</i></p><p><b>&#x2014;Proceedings of the IEEE</b></p><p><i>It is well produced and certainly readable...This material should present no difficulty for fourth-year undergraduates...It also will be useful to advanced workers in that it presents a different approach to wavelet theory from the usual one.</i></p><p><b>&#x2014;Computing Reviews</b></p><p><i>I found this to be an excellent book. It is eminently more readable than the books...which might be considered the principal alternatives for textbooks on wavelets.</i></p><p><b>&#x2014;Physics Today</b> </p><p><i>This volume is probably the most gentle introduction to wavelet theory on the market. As such, it responds to a significant need. The intended audience will profit from the motivation and common-sense explanations in the text. Ultimately, it may lead many readers, who may not otherwise have been able to do so, to go further into wavelet theory, Fourier analysis, and signal processing.</i></p><p><b>&#x2014;SIAM Review</b></p><p><i>The first half of the book is appropriately named. It is a well-written, nicely organized exposition...a welcome addition to the literature. The second part of the book introduces the concept of electromagnetic wavelets...This theory promises to have many other applications and could well lead to new ways of studying these topics. This book has a number of unique features which...makes it particularly valuable for newcomers to the field.</i></p><p><b>&#x2014;Mathematical Reviews</b></p><p><i>The book is indeed what its title promises: A friendly guide to wavelets...In short, Kaiser's book is excellently written and can be considered as one of the best textbooks on this topic presently available...it will enjoy wide distribution among mathematicians and physicists interested in wavelet analysis.</i></p><p><b>&#x2014;Internationale Mathematische Nachrichten</b></p><p>For additional review samples and related material, please visit the author's website at www.wavelets.com.</p></p><h2>Ford Ranger &amp; Mazada B-Series Pick-Ups Automotove Repair Manual (Hayne's Automotive Repair Manual)</h2><p>Used.

In addition to the novels and memoirs for which she is best remembered, she was also a tireless literary and social critic. Starting out as a theater reviewer for <i>Partisan Review</i> in 1937, she quickly distinguished herself for her witty and fearless commentary on topics ranging from McCarthyism to the French New Novel to women&#x2019;s fashion magazines. McCarthy was an eager controversialist, unsparing in her dissection of anything she found phony or hypocritical. Her reviews are sharp, sometimes malicious, and often very funny, but her criticism is also informed by deep erudition and enlivened by an inexhaustible capacity for enthusiasm. Her political writings, critical in equal measure of the Cold War consensus and of its critics, are less concerned with finding correct positions than with exploring the often absurd circumstances in which agonizing moral decisions are made. <br><br>While the soundness of McCarthy&#x2019;s judgments can sometimes be doubted, her curiosity and intelligence cannot. The intellectual brio and acute judgment that characterizes her best fiction is vividly displayed in this selection of essays, which span McCarthy&#x2019;s career from the late 1930s to the late 1970s. It includes her writings on topics such as fashion magazines, Eugene O&#x2019;Neill, <i>A Streetcar Named Desire</i>, <i>Look Back in Anger</i>, <i>Pale Fire</i>, J.D. Salinger, Madame Bovary, Italo Calvino, and Watergate. The volume constitutes not only a valuable record of the ideological and cultural controversies that dominated American intellectual life from the Moscow trials to the Watergate hearings, but will also introduce a new generation of readers to a uniquely forthright and vibrant critical voice.</p><p>Mary McCarthy (1912-1989) was an American novelist, essayist, and critic. Her criticism, literary essays, and social commentary appeared in magazines such as Partisan Review, The Nation, The New Republic, and The New York Review of Books. Her novels include The Company She Keeps (1942), The Oasis (1949), The Groves of Academe (1952), The Group (1963), and Birds of America (1971). She was the author of two travel books about Italy, Venice Observed (1956) and The Stones of Florence (1959), and three works of autobiography. Her controversial essays on the Vietnam War first appeared in The New York Review of Books and were later collected in How it Went (1974).</p><h2>Turnaround Tools for the Teenage Brain: Helping Underperforming Students Become Lifelong Learners</h2><p><b>Powerful research-based strategies to turn around struggling adolescent students</b> <p>The achievement gap is widening and more teens than ever are struggling in school.

Elcock and others.</p><p></p><h2>Introduction to Cryptography with Coding Theory</h2><p>This book assumes a minimal background in programming and a level of math sophistication equivalent to a course in linear algebra. It provides a flexible organization, as each chapter is modular and can be covered in any order. Using Mathematica, Maple, and MATLAB, computer examples included in an Appendix explain how to do computation and demonstrate important concepts. A full chapter on error correcting codes introduces the basic elements of coding theory. Other topics covered: Classical cryptosystems, basic number theory, the data encryption standard, AES: Rijndael, the RSA algorithm, discrete logarithms, digital signatures, e-commerce and digital cash, secret sharing schemes, games, zero knowledge techniques, key establishment protocols, information theory, elliptic curves, error correcting codes, quantum cryptography. For professionals in cryptography and network security.</p><p><p> This book is based on a course in cryptography at the upper level undergraduate and beginning graduate level that has been given at the University of Maryland since 1997. When designing the course, we decided on the following requirements. </p><p> <br>* The course should be up-to-date and cover a broad selection of topics from a mathematical point of view. <br>* The material should be accessible to mathematically mature students having little background in number theory and computer programming. <br>* There should be examples involving numbers large enough to demonstrate how the algorithms really work. <br> </p><p> We wanted to avoid concentrating solely on RSA and discrete logarithms, which would have made the course mostly a number theory course. We also did not want to teach a course on protocols and how to hack into friends' computers. That would have made the course less mathematical than desired. </p><p> There are numerous topics in cryptology that can be discussed in an introductory course. We have tried to include many of them. The chapters represent, for the most part, topics that were covered during the different semesters we taught the course. There is certainly more material here than could be treated in most one-semester courses. The first eight chapters represent the core of the material. The choice of which of the remaining chapters are used depends on the level of the students. </p><p> The chapters are numbered, thus giving them an ordering. However, except for Chapter 3 on number theory, which pervades the subject, the chapters are fairly independent of each other and can be covered in almost any reasonable order. Although we don't recommend doing so, a daring reader could possibly read Chapters 4 through 17 in reverse order, with only having to look ahead/behind a few times. </p><p> The chapters on Information Theory, Elliptic Curves, (quantum Methods, and Error Correcting Codes are somewhat more mathematical than the others. The chapter on Error Correcting Codes was included, at the suggestion of several reviewers, because courses that include introductions to both cryptology and coding theory are fairly common. </p><p> Computer examples. Suppose you want to give an example for RSA. You could choose two one-digit primes and pretend to be working with fifty-digit primes, or you could use your favorite software package to do an actual example with large primes. Or perhaps you are working with shift ciphers and are trying to decrypt a message by trying all 26 shifts of the ciphertext. This should also be done on a computer. At the end of the book are appendices containing Computer Examples written in each of Mathematica�, Maple�, and MATLAB� that show how to do such calculations. These languages were chosen because they are user friendly and do not require prior programming experience. Although the course has been taught successfully without computers, these examples are an integral part of the book and should be studied, if at all possible. Not only do they contain numerical examples of how to do certain computations but also they demonstrate important ideas and issues that arise. They were placed at the end of the book because of the logistic and aesthetic problems of including extensive computer examples in three languages at the ends of chapters. </p><p> Programs available in each of the three languages can be downloaded from the Web site<br> prenhall/washington </p><p> In a classroom, all that is needed is a computer (with one of the languages installed) and a projector in order to produce meaningful examples as the lecture is being given. Homework problems (the Computer Problems in various chapters) based on the software allow students to play with examples individually. Of course, students having more programming background could write their own programs instead. <br></p></p><h2>Sex and Money ...Are Dirty, Aren&#39;t They?: A Two - Part Guided Journal</h2><p><b>Sex and Money</b> is a guided journal that provides exercises to lead readers to look at their attitudes, beliefs, and struggles with sex and money, subjects often thought to be outside the realm of spiritual practice.

Includes discussion questions.</p><p>The young Robert Louis Stevenson suffered from repeated nightmares of living a double life, in which by day he worked as a respectable doctor and by night he roamed the back alleys of old-town Edinburgh. In three days of furious writing, he produced a story about his dream existence. His wife found it too gruesome, so he promptly burned the manuscript. In another three days, he wrote it again. <i>The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</i> was published as a "shilling shocker" in 1886, and became an instant classic. In the first six months, 40,000 copies were sold. Queen Victoria read it. Sermons and editorials were written about it. When Stevenson and his family visited America a year later, they were mobbed by reporters at the dock in New York City. Compulsively readable from its opening pages, <i>Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</i> is still one of the best tales ever written about the divided self. <p> This University of Nebraska Press edition is a small, exquisitely produced paperback. The book design, based on the original first edition of 1886, includes wide margins, decorative capitals on the title page and first page of each chapter, and a clean, readable font that is 19th-century in style. Joyce Carol Oates contributes a foreword in which she calls Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde a "mythopoetic figure" like Frankenstein, Dracula, and Alice in Wonderland, and compares Stevenson's creation to doubled selves in the works of Plato, Poe, Wilde, and Dickens. </p><p> This edition also features 12 full-page wood engravings by renowned illustrator Barry Moser. Moser is a skillful reader and interpreter as well as artist, and his afterword to the book, in which he explains the process by which he chose a self-portrait motif for the suite of engravings, is fascinating. For the image of Edward Hyde, he writes, "I went so far as to have my dentist fit me out with a carefully sculpted prosthetic of evil-looking teeth. But in the final moments I had to abandon the idea as being inappropriate. It was more important to stay in keeping with the text and, like Stevenson, not show Hyde's face."

Others angrily reject the designation. What stakes would being an empire have for our identity at home and our role abroad? </p><p> </p><p> A preeminent American historian addresses these issues in light of the history of empires since antiquity. This elegantly written book examines the structure and impact of these mega-states and asks whether the United States shares their traits and behavior. Eschewing the standard focus on current U.S. foreign policy and the recent spate of pro- and anti-empire polemics, Charles S. Maier uses comparative history to test the relevance of a concept often invoked but not always understood. Marshaling a remarkable array of evidence--from Roman, Ottoman, Moghul, Spanish, Russian, Chinese, and British experience--Maier outlines the essentials of empire throughout history. He then explores the exercise of U.S. power in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, carefully analyzing its economic and strategic sources and the nation's relationship to predecessors and rivals. </p><p> </p><p> To inquire about empire is to ask what the United States has become as a result of its wealth, inventiveness, and ambitions. It is to confront lofty national aspirations with the realities of the violence that often attends imperial politics and thus to question both the costs and the opportunities of the current U.S. global ascendancy. With learning, dispassion, and clarity, <i>Among Empires</i> offers bold comparisons and an original account of American power. It confirms that the issue of empire must be a concern of every citizen. </p></p><p>Charles S. Maier is Leverett Saltonstall Professor of History at Harvard University and author of <i>Dissolution: The Crisis of Communism and the End of East Germany</i>.This is a truly masterly essay, which brilliantly succeeds in setting the phenomenon of American ascendancy in its proper historical context&#x2014;as the one of many forms of imperial organization. Much has been written of late on the subject of American empire. In its multi-faceted erudition and its scrupulous ambivalence, <i>Among Empires</i> is in a league of its own. I cannot praise it too highly. I envy its author's scholarship and the wonderful subtlety of his analysis. (Niall Ferguson, author of <i>Empire: The Rise and Demise of the British World Order and the Lessons for Global Power</i>)<br><br>Many of us wonder in what ways our country is--and is not--like the empires of the past. We wonder, too, if we can profit from their triumphs or learn from their failures. In this elegantly written tour de force of fair-minded comparative history, Charles Maier provides us with the materials for answering these questions for ourselves. (Kwame Anthony Appiah, author of <i>The Ethics of Identity</i>)<br><br>Charles Maier's explorations of imperial predicaments are both broad and deep. His historically rich and analytically focused approach illuminates America's ascendancy in world affairs. This elegant book is a gem of circumspect wisdom. (Peter J. Katzenstein, author of <i>A World of Regions: Asia and Europe in the American Imperium</i>)<br><br>Powerful in analysis, rich in learning, dazzling in historical sweep and elegant in style, <i>Among Empires</i> will become a modern classic, indispensable to our understanding of the powerful forces that govern our world. (Ronald Steel, author of <i>Temptations of a Superpower</i>)<br><br>Maier's brilliant study of the nature of imperial power throughout history offers a glimpse not only at the character of empire but also at how the current American political regime measures up to past empires...Maier's subtle study brooks no rivals in its assessment of American empire. (Starred review) (<i>Publishers Weekly</i> 2006-02-20)<br><br>Maier has a masterful historic grasp and his analysis is wide-ranging and comprehensive. However, this is by no means an introductory book, and students who wish to know more about the subject will be challenged by its discursive and reflective style. On the other hand, for those who have an understanding of the issues, Maier's virtuoso analysis and its broad historic sweep will be both informative and entertaining. The book makes a major contribution to current debates and should be widely consulted by anyone interested in contemporary international events. (<i>Journal of Sociology and Social Welfare</i> 2007-06-01)<br><br>Having defined empire and laid out the precedents, Maier traces the last sixty years of American action on the world stage. Readers can judge for themselves if and when the U.S. turned imperial. (James Morone <i>London Review of Books</i> 2007-06-21)<br><br>Charles Maier has pulled off a remarkable feat by writing a book on empire that dwells largely on the recent history of the United States and that is explicitly and even agressively nonpartisan.

In what has become one of science's greatest riddles, these large animals vanished in North and South America around the time humans arrived at the end of the last great ice age. Part paleontological adventure and part memoir, <i>Twilight of the Mammoths </i>presents in detail internationally renowned paleoecologist Paul Martin's widely discussed and debated "overkill" hypothesis to explain these mysterious megafauna extinctions. Taking us from Rampart Cave in the Grand Canyon, where he finds himself "chest deep in sloth dung," to other important fossil sites in Arizona and Chile, Martin's engaging book, written for a wide audience, uncovers our rich evolutionary legacy and shows why he has come to believe that the earliest Americans literally hunted these animals to death.<br><br>As he discusses the discoveries that brought him to this hypothesis, Martin relates many colorful stories and gives a rich overview of the field of paleontology as well as his own fascinating career. He explores the ramifications of the overkill hypothesis for similar extinctions worldwide and examines other explanations for the extinctions, including climate change. Martin's visionary thinking about our missing megafauna offers inspiration and a challenge for today's conservation efforts as he speculates on what we might do to remedy this situation&#x2014;both in our thinking about what is "natural" and in the natural world itself.</p><p>"Paul S.

Now, in <em>West of Everything</em>, Tompkins shows how popular novels and films of the American west have shaped the emotional lives of people in our time.<br> Into this world full of violence and manly courage, the world of John Wayne and Louis L'Amour, Tompkins takes her readers, letting them feel what the hero feels, endure what he endures. Writing with sympathy, insight, and respect, she probes the main elements of the Western--its preoccupation with death, its barren landscapes, galloping horses, hard-bitten men and marginalized women--revealing the view of reality and code of behavior these features contain. She considers the Western hero's attraction to pain, his fear of women and language, his desire to dominate the environment--and to merge with it. In fact, Tompkins argues, for better or worse Westerns have taught us all--men especially--how to behave.<br> It was as a reaction against popular women's novels and women's invasion of the public sphere that Westerns originated, Tompkins maintains. With Westerns, men were reclaiming cultural territory, countering the inwardness, spirituality, and domesticity of the sentimental writers, with a rough and tumble, secular, man-centered world. Tompkins brings these insights to bear in considering film classics such as <em>Red River</em> and <em>Lonely Are the Brave</em>, and novels such as Louis L'Amour's <em>Last of the Breed</em> and Owen Wister's <em>The Virginian</em>. In one of the most moving chapters (chosen for <em>Best</em> <em>American Essays of 1991</em>), Ttompkins shows how the life of Buffalo Bill Cody, killer of Native Americans and charismatic star of the Wild West show, evokes the contradictory feelings which the Western typically elicits--horror and fascination with violence, but also love and respect for the romantic ideal of the cowboy.<br> Whether interpreting a photograph of John Wayne of meditating on the slaughter of cattle, Jane Tompkins writes with humor, compassion, and a provocative intellect. Her book will appeak to many Americans who read or watch Westerns, and to all those interested in a serious approach to popular culture.<br></p><p><br><em>About the Author:</em> <strong>Jane Tompkins</strong> is Professor of English at Duke University. She is author of <em>Sensational Designs</em> and the editor of <em>Reader Response Criticism</em>.<br>"The feminist perspective of West of Everything makes it invaluable to the ongoing critical discourse on Westerns."--The San Francisco Chronicle<br><br>"Jane Tompkins knows her Western through and through; she handles details, events and scenes from novels and movies with skill and surety....She brings spirit, energy, freshness and originality to a field of study that has long been buried many feet deep in cliches."--Patricia Nelson Limerick,<br>The Boston Sunday Globe<br><br>"A passionate and generous book."--Newsday<br><br>"Interesting and thought-provoking."--Library Journal<br><br>"In explaining how she overcame her prejudices against the Western Tompkins illuminates the genre as few others ever have."--Hubert I. Cohen, University of Michigan<br><br>"A daring and confrontational literary essay meant to rattle the peace of mind of just about every cowboy on the face of the earth....Throughout her book [Tompkins] evidences a charm, honesty, and sense of intellectual adventure that would make her a happy pardner on a long ride....And why do<br>I love Miz Tompkins so much for bush-whacking the myth of the West inside me? Because she's right."--John Calvin Batchelor, Washington Post Book World<br><br>"Anyone who cares about American popular culture could profit from reading this masterpiece."--Booklist<br><br>"We've long recognized that the western is a basic myth of masculinity. Thus, it's not surprising that a woman scholar might have, if not the last word, at least a good deal to say about the genre. What's even more striking is that Jane Tompkins in West of Everything not only develops an<br>insightful feminist critique of the western as macho mythos, but also has some brilliant observations to make about the genre's compelling artistic and cultural force. This is not simply gender criticism, but cultural and aesthetic analysis at its most fascinating."--John G. Cawelti, University of<br>Kentucky<br><br>"Treating both Western novels and Western movies, Jane Tompkins argues that there is nothing trivial about the desires they arouse or the violence they persuade us to applaud. By the end of her study, she forces us to confront that righteous ecstasy through which, for one brief moment, we all<br>share in the murderous discharge of tension which traditionally concludes the Western. It is a chilling and provocative Epilogue to a book that movingly demonstrates why this famous feminist critic has always found herself both attracted to and repelled by the power of cowboy heroes. In short, a<br>bracing and sobering analysis."--Annette Kolodny, author of The Lay of the Land and The Land Before Her<br><br>"[A] captivating, witty study....A great read. One comes away hard-pressed to imagine any writer topping Tompkin's feat of integrating the western and the way Americans think."--Denver Post</p><h2>On the Road of the Winds: An Arch�ological History of the Pacific Islands before European Contact</h2><p>The Pacific Ocean covers one-third of the earth's surface and encompasses many thousands of islands, the home to numerous human societies and cultures. Among these indigenous Oceanic cultures are the intrepid Polynesian double-hulled canoe navigators, the atoll dwellers of Micronesia, the statue carvers of remote Easter Island, and the famed traders of Melanesia. Recent archaeological excavations, combined with allied research in historical linguistics, biological anthropology, and comparative ethnography, have begun to reveal much new information about the long-term history of these Pacific Island societies and cultures. <i>On the Road of the Winds</i> synthesizes the grand sweep of human history in the Pacific Islands, beginning with the movement of early people out from Asia more than 40,000 years ago, and tracing the development of myriad indigenous cultures up to the time of European contact in the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries.<br><br> Questions that scholars have posed and puzzled over for two centuries or more are illuminated here: Where did the Pacific Islanders come from? How did they discover and settle the thousands of islands? Why did they build great monuments like Nan Madol on Pohnpei Island in Micronesia or the famous Easter Island statues? This book provides an up-to-date synthesis of archaeological and historical anthropological knowledge of these fascinating indigenous cultures.<br><br> In particular, Kirch focuses on human ecology and island adaptations, the complexities of island trading and exchange systems, voyaging technology and skills, and the development of intensive economic systems linked to the growth of large populations. He also draws on his own original field research conducted on many islands, ranging from the Solomons to Hawai'i, as he takes us on an intellectual voyage into the Oceanic past.</p><p>"Pat Kirch summarizes the extraordinary explosion of the last two decades in our knowledge of Pacific prehistory, an explosion to which he has contributed more than anyone. His synthesis brings together results from all of the subfields of anthropology--ethnography, archaeology, biological anthropology, and linguistics.. . . No one knows this material as well or can present it in such an effective manner. This book should stand for a generation as the major synthesis of Oceanic prehistory."&#x2014;Timothy Earle, author of <i>How Chiefs Come to Power</i><br><br>"After nearly four decades of teaching the culture history of Oceania, I can say this is the only up-to-date work that gives a balanced and detailed account of Polynesia, Micronesia, Island Melanesia, and Papua-New Guinea.

Published in 1965 after a long and circuitous route throughout all four years of the council, Dei Verbum sets forth the Catholic Church&#x2019;s official teaching about divine revelation and the complex interrelationship between Scripture and Tradition. With the approach of the fiftieth anniversary of the constitution, this book&#x2014;intended for general audiences&#x2014;summarizes the history and principal teaching of this groundbreaking document. Accompanying the text of The Word of God at Vatican II is a paragraph-by-paragraph commentary and an exploration of the impact the constitution has had in the church&#x2019;s life. Readers will be amazed at how influential Dei Verbum continues to be, even today.<br> &nbsp;</p><p><p>Ronald D.

Bound in real cloth, printed on high quality paper, and featuring ribbon markers and gilt edges, Macmillan Collector's Library are books to love and treasure. </p><p>When <i>A Christmas Carol</i> was first published in 1843 it was an overnight success, and set a precedent that was to be followed by other Christmas books, including <i>The Chimes</i> (1844) and <i>The Cricket</i> (1845). Each book was published at the same time of year, in the same format, and extolled similar values about the virtues of love, charity and the family unit. But none would achieve the cult status of <i>A Christmas Carol</i>, a book so popular it has become part of the landscape of the traditional Christmas, or produce a character as extraordinarily memorable. A celebration of Christmas, a tale of redemption and a critique on Victorian society, Dickens&#x2019; atmospheric novella follows the miserly, penny-pinching Ebenezer Scrooge who views Christmas as &#x2018;humbug&#x2019;. It is only through a series of eerie, life-changing visits from the ghost of his deceased business partner Marley and the spirits of Christmas past, present and future that he begins to see the error of his ways. With heart-rending characters, rich imagery and evocative language, the message of <i>A Christmas Carol</i> remains as significant today as when it was first published.</p><p>Original illustrations by John Leech, with an afterword by Anna South.</p></p><p>In the history of English literature, Charles Dickens's <i>A Christmas Carol</i>, which has been continuously in print since it was first published in the winter of 1843, stands out as the quintessential Christmas story. What makes this charming edition of Dickens's immortal tale so special is the collection of 80 vivid illustrations by Everett Shinn (1876-1953). Shinn, a well-known artist in his time, was a popular illustrator of newspapers and magazines whose work displayed a remarkable affinity for the stories of Charles Dickens, evoking the bustling street life of the mid-1800s. Printed on heavy, cream-colored paper stock, the edges of the pages have been left rough, simulating the way in which the story might have appeared in Dickens's own time. Though countless editions of this classic have been published over the years, this one stands out as particularly beautiful, nostalgic, and evocative of the spirit of Christmas.<p>Traditional cover with this full-color gift edition in a slipcase.</p></p><h2>Feathered Serpents and Flowering Trees: Reconstructing the Murals at Teotihuacan</h2><p>Describes the Wagner collection of ancient Mexican murals</p><p></p><h2>The Picture of Dorian Gray (SparkNotes Literature Guide) (SparkNotes Literature Guide Series)</h2><p><b><i>Get your "A" in gear!</i></b><br><br>They're today's most popular study guides-with everything you need to succeed in school.

Edward Tufte, a political scientist who covered the 1976 Presidential election for <i>Newsweek</i>, seeks to do just that. His sharp analyses and astute observations lead to an eye-opening view of the impact of political life on the national economy of America and other capitalist democracies.</p><br><br><p>The analysis demonstrates how politicians, political parties, and voters decide who gets what, when, and how in the economic arena. A nation's politics, it is argued, shape the most important aspects of economic life--inflation, unemployment, income redistribution, the growth of government, and the extent of central economic control. Both statistical data and case studies (based on interviews and Presidential documents) are brought to bear on four topics. They are: 1) the political manipulation of the economy in election years, 2) the new international electoral-economic cycle, 3) the decisive role of political leaders and parties in shaping macroeconomic outcomes, and 4) the response of the electorate to changing economic conditions. Finally, the book clarifies a central question in political economy: How can national economic policy be conducted in both a <i>democratic</i> and a <i>competent</i> fashion?</p></p><p>"A remarkable study, one that is provocative and concise, sometimes brazen in its theoretical assumptions and assertions, laced throughout with elegance and wit.

(<i>American Political Science Review</i>)<br><br>"Of late, a growing number of political scientists and economists have been attempting to see if there is a relationship, here and abroad, between the &#x2018;political cycle' (that is, periodic elections) and the business cycle (the ups and downs of various measures of economic well-being).

Many of the texts Peter Dronke presents and interprets have hitherto remained unknown, or virtually inaccessible; some have never been edited or translated before. The emphasis throughout is on personal testimonies, and on texts that have notable literary or intellectual interest. Thus the book affords many new insights into medieval literature, not only into the writings of renowned women such as Hrotsvitha or Heloise, but also into those of a number of neglected writers who are exceptional in their gifts and individuality. Already highly influential, Women Writers of the Middle Ages continues to be essential reading for specialists and students alike in medieval literature, medieval intellectual history, and women&#39;s studies.</p><p>'Women Writers of the Middle Ages compels us to re-examine our fundamental assumptions about medieval literature; it forces us to reconsider what constitutes good or even great literature and on what tenets literary canonization operates.'

Schultz draws upon three decades of work as a neuropsychologist, teacher educator, and school consultant to address this gap. This book can help change the way parents and teachers think about why kids with LD and ADHD find school and homework so toxic. It will also offer an abundant supply of practical, understandable strategies that have been shown to reduce stress at school and at home.</p> <ul> <li>Offers a new way to look at why kids with ADHD/LD struggle at school</li> <li>Provides effective strategies to reduce stress in kids with ADHD and LD</li> <li>Includes helpful rating scales, checklists, and printable charts to use at school and home</li> </ul> <p>This important resource is written by a faculty member of Harvard Medical School in the Department of Psychiatry and former classroom teacher.</p></p><p><p>For decades, politicians have spent thousands of hours writing legislation aimed at helping kids with ADHD and learning disabilities (LD). Parents and schools have spent billions of dollars getting children tested and delivering special education services. Despite all this, most kids with ADHD/LD still hate school. Why haven't we been able to find the solution to this problem? We've been looking in the wrong place.</p><p>Current efforts to help children with ADHD/LD don't work because they don't take into account that these kids are under chronic stress. They are required daily to do what for them is physically impossible staying focused, reading with peers, sitting still and live in a constant state of feeling inadequate and embarrassed. To protect themselves, children use the defenses nature provided them: they freeze, fight, or flee. The problem is that kids with ADHD/LD in school have no place to run, no place to hide, and all too often they get labeled or punished if they shut down or fight learning. Chronic stress impacts kids' brain functioning, behavior, social skills, and academic learning. Nowhere to Hide shines a light on this important yet overlooked phenomenon in the lives of children with ADHD/LD, offering guidance for parents and teachers to help kids improve learning, behavior, and self-esteem. </p><p>Jerome Schultz reframes kids' behavior as Saving FASE (Fear, Avoidance, Stress, and Escape) and provides his step-by-step DE-STRESS model, which helps kids reduce stress at school and at home.

As school gets harder, this problem is getting worse. What can I do? </b><br> Ask your son's teacher to &#x201c;prime the pump&#x201d; by giving the kids the opportunity to do the first two homework problems together before going home. This way, your son will have his homework page all set up and when he pulls it out, he&#x2019;ll have the first two done correctly. This will serve as a "competence anchor," and should increase the likelihood that his brain is saying &#x201c;I can&#x201d; rather than "I can't." <br><br> <b>Our 10-yr old daughter can write for hours about a topic she's interested in. But when her teacher asks her to write on a particular subject or if the assignment is structured in any way, she shuts down. We can&#x2019;t just let her write these open-ended stories forever...any suggestions? </b><br> Journals or "sagas" can just flow, because there are no required stops and starts or changes in topic. Structured writing requires a special kind of mental organization. Some kids can't think in "outline" form, and they get stressed when asked to condense a huge topic or to put their thoughts in a particular order. Here's an idea that has built a bridge to required writing for many kids: line up 4-6 photographs of an experience your daughter has had (like a field trip, or vacation), and have her write about these in sequence. (It&#x2019;s even better if she was the photographer!) She'll be familiar with the scene and the order in which the events happened, both of which reduce task-related anxiety. Teachers can do the same kind of activity by printing out slides or pictures that your little girl can put into order (and maybe do this with a classmate, for fun), and then write a short essay about what she has just thought about. If your daughter balks at writing, let her dictate the story to you while you type it. Then she can cut and paste images and personalize the piece. The key here is to create a mental image of the event and the sequence, to make it more familiar and put some boundaries on the material. <br><br> <b>My son Aiden (age 8) talks and talks and talks and talks! It used to be cute--we've even got a YouTube video of it! But in school, it's a real turn-off to other kids (and, we imagine, to his teacher as well). We don't want to keep telling him he has to "let other people talk," or keep saying "Now, be a good listener, Aiden." What can we do to get him to be more aware of his communication style and take better charge of it? </b><br> Kids who talk non-stop often need more "training" when they&#x2019;re not in these social situations. The training should be fun. Some ideas: Give Aiden a tape recorder and hand him an object, or show him a picture. Tell him he &#x201c;has to&#x201d; talk for 1 minute, but then has to stop. Then play back what he has said on tape, and reinforce the story he has told, but more important, his ability to stop when he's supposed to. After practicing this several times, try it without the tape recorder, asking him to "find his own stop button," and turn himself off when he thinks he's talked for a minute. You time him. If he overruns the clock, say "stop." If he "beats the clock," all the better. He's showing self-control-- which is the name of this game. Then switch roles, and let Aiden time you! <br><br> You can also play a "build-a-story" game in which each of you (or later, more family members) tell a piece of a story that the next person must build upon. Set a time limit (ring a bell, or knock on the table) when 30 seconds is up. The rule is "you can finish the sentence you just started, but you have to stop and turn the story over to the next story-teller." This can be hilariously funny and lots of fun. Remember, when there&#x2019;s humor, the brain works in more positive, helpful ways. If the teacher or the speech/language therapist at school is made aware of this kind of practice, they can use the same verbal strategies in school, including some of the same verbal cues that encourage awareness of others and self-control, such as, "Time to hit the 'pause' button, Aiden." <br><br> <b>We've had our daughter tested several times. She has some significant challenges, to be sure, but the reports always sound so negative. Our little girl also has some outstanding strengths that don't show up in the testing situation. So when teachers and others read the report, they get a very skewed view of her abilities, and they tend to focus on her weaknesses. Do you have any advice for us? </b><br> Make a portfolio that shows your daughter's accomplishments and talents. This can be a scrapbook with pictures, arranged year-by-year to show changes and growth, or it can be a more current display of her skills. Photos that show your daughter engaged with other kids in a fun activity, acting in a play, playing music, or even playing quietly or reading in cozy corner, can help to convey her many or emerging skills. If you&#x2019;re tech-savvy, you can create a personal website for your child. She can even be involved at making or editing her own website and videos. For example, she could be interviewed about "how I learn best," or "I can be more successful when my teachers..." This is not like a Grandma's "brag book," but rather a way to show teachers and other professionals what she&#x2019;s like at her best. This "personal PR" helps keep their expectations high but reasonable, and it encourages them to create opportunities for her to demonstrate her skills and talents and also to work on strengthening her weaker areas. And those reports with a negative tone? Give the psychologist your daughter&#x2019;s "I CAN DO THIS" scrapbook or her web address before they start the testing! I can assure you that this will put more balance into the report. <br><br><p><b>PRAISE FOR NOWHERE TO HIDE</b> </p><p>"[Some 10-15% of America's kids] fight the battle of learning disabilities and attention deficits every day.

Evans-Pritchard examines the various theories which have been put forth by anthropologists to account for the religions of primitive peoples - and, by implication, religion in general. He begins by discussing some of the difficulties and problems in studies of primitive religions, and then offers a critique of intellectualist, emotionalist, and sociological theories of religion. The book is intended for those who are interested in the history of ideas about religion, and as an introductory textbook for students of anthropology and comparative religion.&#34;</p><p>In this book E.E.

Often black and white or tinted sepia, these remarkable images have been taken mainly in zoos or wildlife parks, and in some cases depict the last known individual of the species. <i>Lost Animals</i> is a unique photographic record of extinction, presented by a world authority on vanished animals. Richly illustrated throughout, this handsome book features photographs dating from around 1870 to as recently as 2004, the year that witnessed the demise of the Hawaiian Po'ouli. From a mother Thylacine and her pups to birds such as the Heath Hen and the Carolina Parakeet, Errol Fuller tells the story of each animal, explains why it became extinct, and discusses the circumstances surrounding the photography.</p><p>Covering 28 extinct species, <i>Lost Animals</i> includes familiar examples like the last Passenger Pigeon, Martha, and one of the last Ivory-billed Woodpeckers, photographed as it peers quizzically at the hat of one of the biologists who has just ringed it. But the book includes rare images as well, many never before published. Collected together here for the first time, these photographs provide a tangible link to animals that have now vanished forever, in a book that brings the past to life while delivering a warning for the future.</p><p>Poignant and compelling, <i>Lost Animals</i> also includes a concise introduction that looks at the earliest days of animal photography, and an appendix of drawings and paintings of the species covered.</p></p><p><p>"The species accounts are engaging, and I can truthfully say that I learned something in every case.

That year Owen Wister, a native of Philadelphia, published the novel that established the conventions of the western. An immediate best seller, it has never faded from public consciousness. Suddenly there was the natural aristocrat, the Virginian, who faced down the archetypal villain. Trampas, flinging at him the unforgettable words "When you call me that, smile!" There was the eastern schoolteacher, Molly, far from being a wilted flower. They moved in the raw, bracing atmosphere that generations of readers and moviegoers would come to expect from westerns.

A fascinating assessment which argues that children in today&#39;s fast-paced electronic world use their brains differently than did children in past generations.</p><p>The subtitle is the basic premise of this volume. According to the author, the present generation is not receiving the educational foundation needed to foster analytical thought processes. The current trend toward preschool preparedness and the use of such programs as Sesame Street to enhance the child's learning may teach the child to read but fails to develop critical reasoning processes. Today's students have no ability in language-related learning, are inattentive, and are not successful problem solvers. Healy relies on current research findings to support the theory of "plasticity of the brain"--the changeability of the brain in both function and physical size in direct response to environmental and experiential stimuli. The final chapters, offering advice to parents on helping the child to become a critical thinker both at home and in school, make this valuable for public libraries; the excellent bibliography makes this a worthwhile selection for readers knowledgeable in neuropsychology as it pertains to the field of education.<br><i>- A.R.

It sets the stage for an array of case-study volumes, each of which focuses on a single area of the world. Each case study uses the contemporary musical situation as a point of departure, covering historical information and traditions as they relate to the present. Visit www.oup.com/us/globalmusic for a list of case studies in the <strong>Global Music Series</strong>. The website also includes instructional materials to accompany each study. <br> <em>Music in Bulgaria</em> presents a focused introduction to the rich and varied tradition of Bulgarian music. Taking readers on a tour of the country's musical landscape, it explores ways in which Bulgaria's rural traditions affect the expression and interpretation of its music and examines how Bulgaria's history has influenced its music over many decades. The book also shows how musical traditions have been preserved and have flourished despite the social changes brought about by the post-WWII era of industrialization, modernization, and urbanization. Timothy Rice demonstrates how Bulgarian music--in addition to being an art and an entertainment--is deeply embedded in the cultural, social, economic, and political life of the country. He analyzes how this music has spread to other cultures and how it has made its mark on new forms of popular music. Brief lessons on how ethnomusicologists conduct their research are also included. <br> Written in a lively style accessible to both students and general readers, <em>Music in Bulgaria</em> features vivid eyewitness accounts of performances, interviews with performers, and glossaries of Bulgarian and musical terms. Incorporating numerous listening examples and other activities that help readers learn to listen, sing, and dance to Bulgarian music, this volume is packaged with a 70-minute CD containing examples of the music discussed.<br></p><p>Timothy Rice is at UCLA. Bonnie C. Wade is at University of Washington.<br>"<em>Music in Bulgaria</em> is a valuable addition to ethnomusicology's instructional literature.

It is in the genre of Augustine&#39;s Confessions and Thomas a Kempis&#39;s Imitation of Christ. Written in 1666, Grace Abounding chronicles Bunyan&#39;s spiritual journey from a profane life filled with cursing, blasphemy, and Sabbath desecration to a new creation in Christ Jesus.</p><p>From his conversion and through many trials and temptations, Bunyan reveals how the grace of the Lord was extended to him so that he learned to surrender all of self and rely totally<br> on Christ.John Bunyan was born in Elstow, Bedfordshire, England, in 1628. He learned to read and write at the village school and was prepared to follow his father&#39;s trade as a brazier when the English Civil War broke out in 1644 and he was drafted into the Parliamentary army. His military service brought him into contact with Oliver Cromwell&#39;s Puritan troops. Beginning in 1648, Bunyan suffered a crisis in religious faith that lasted for several years. He turned to the Nonconformist church in Bedford to sustain him during this period. His first writings were attacks against the Quakers. Then Charles II was restored to the throne and Bunyan was arrested for conducting services not in accordance with the Church of England. He spent 12 years in jail. During this time, he wrote his autobiography, Grace Abounding, in which he described his spiritual struggle and growth. During his last years in prison, Bunyan began his most famous work, The Pilgrim&#39;s Progress, a two-part allegorical tale of the character Christian and his journey to salvation. Part I was published in 1678 and Part II in 1684. The second part deals with the spiritual journey of Christian&#39;s wife and sons, as they follow in his footsteps. With its elements of the folktale tradition, The Pilgrim&#39;s Progress became popular immediately. Well into the nineteenth century it was a book known to almost every reader in England and New England, second in importance only to the Bible. So great was the book&#39;s influence that it even plays a major role in Little Woman by Louisa May Alcott. Such expressions as &#34;the slough of despond&#34; and &#34;vanity fair&#34; have become part of the English language. Bunyan&#39;s other works include The Life and Death of Mr. Badman and The Holy War. He also wrote A Book for Boys and Girls, verses on religious faith for children. Bunyan died in London on August 31, 1688.</p><h2>Little Men</h2><p><p>The beloved sequel to <i>Little Women</i>, this classic continues the story of Jo March, who goes on to get married and inherit an estate with which she creates an experimental school for boys.</p></p><p><p>Jo March, the tomboy heroine of <i>Little Women,</i> has grown up! She returns in this beloved sequel as a young woman with a family of her own. Jo and her husband, Professor Bhaer, open their hearts (and their home) to educate and care for a handful of rowdy yet well-meaning youngsters.<br>Plumfield, the school where the boys learn "how to help themselves and be useful men," has a spirited student body that includes&#x2014;in addition to the Bhaers' two sons&#x2014;Nat, an orphaned street musician, cold and frightened when he first appears at the Bhaers' door; business-minded Tommy; Dan, a "wild boy" eventually tamed by love and kindness; and other endearing little mischief-makers.<br>Outside the classroom, the boys rush headlong from one prank to another&#x2014;from playing matador with the family cow to nearly setting the school afire with a smoldering cigar stub. But in the end, they prove to have a positive effect on the lives of the entire Bhaer family.</p><p></p>Louisa May Alcott was both an abolitionist and a feminist. She is best known for Little Women (1868), a semiautobiographical account of her childhood years with her sisters in Concord, Massachusetts. Alcott, unlike Jo, never married: &#34;&#34;...because I have fallen in love with so many pretty girls and never once the least bit with any man.&#34;&#34; She was an advocate of women&#39;s suffrage and was the first woman to register to vote in Concord, Massachusetts.</p><h2>Brave, Generous &amp; Undefended: Heart Teachings on the 37 Bodhisattva Practices</h2><p><i>Brave, Generous, and Undefended</i> is a profound teaching on how to become and how to live as a bodhisattva, dedicated to the liberation of all. To the classic pith instructions of "The 37 Bodhisattva Practices," by 14th-century Tibetan teacher Tokme Zangpo, contemporary Western teacher Barbara Du Bois brings her fresh, energetic, penetrating wisdom from the heart. Rich with insight and fearless love, these teachings embrace us as participants in intimate, dynamic discussions that vividly demonstrate the transformational power of the bodhisattva intention in relation to life purpose, suffering, relationships, and spiritual path. Arrows of love and truth pierce our illusions of self and separation, showing us that we already are what we aspire to become: embodiments of truth and love. This profound and practical book will encourage, guide, and invigorate beginning seekers and advanced practitioners in any tradition, as well as those with or without a formal spiritual path.<br> "The 37 Bodhisattva Practices," considered the essence of the enlightenment path, require no erudite explanations or secret initiations, but they do upend our minds, so it is helpful to have a teacher unpack them for us. Du Bois delights in the task, as a longtime practitioner familiar with both the tricky conditioned mind and what it is hiding from. Addressing both our own longings for happiness and freedom and the root causes of our confusion and pain, the bodhisattva trainings turn our self-absorption inside out, revealing the good heart that seeks ultimate freedom &#x2013; for all. Du Bois&#x2019;s teachings show clearly how love and compassion bring us onto the bodhisattva path, in the intentional, wholehearted process that transmutes mind of self-grasping to the &#x201c;awakening mind,&#x201d; bodhicitta. Her invitation: take what speaks to you and test it for yourself; contemplate and practice on it until you attain confidence, and then continue, for the benefit of all.</p><p>Barbara Du Bois, Ph.D., longtime teacher of Buddhadharma, is known for the clarity, freshness, humor, and fearless love with which she shines a frank Western light on the path. Her principal gurus are Padmasambhava, Milarepa, Machig, H. H. Dudjom Rinpoche, and H.E. Garchen Rinpoche. Barbara&#x2019;s lifetime of service includes work with disarmament, African refugees from colonial regimes and genocide, United Nations social development, feminist scholarship and teaching, and initiating an indigenous women&#x2019;s peace movement during active civil war in Africa. She holds the doctorate from Harvard University and has taught at undergraduate and graduate levels as social scientist, psychologist, and psychotherapist. Barbara is also a visual artist and author of <i> Light Years: A Spiritual Memoir</i> (Laughing Vajra, 2011) and the forthcoming <i>Brave, Generous, &amp; Undefended: Heart Teachings on the 37 Bodhisattva Practices</i> (White Cloud, in press). She currently resides in Arizona.<br><br>His Eminence Garchen Triptrul Rinpoche, the Eighth Garchen Rinpoche, is a renowned and beloved teacher in the Drikung Kagyu lineage of Tibetan Buddhism. Born in 1936 in Nangchen Kham, at age seven Rinpoche was enthroned at Lho Miyal Monastery and given his ordination name, K�nchok Gyaltsen. At age twenty-two, during the turmoil of the Cultural Revolution, Garchen Rinpoche was imprisoned in a Chinese labor camp. There he met Khenpo Munsel, a great Nyingma master, who became his root guru. During twenty years of incarceration, while enduring prison hardships, Rinpoche practiced in secret according to his guru&#x2019;s instructions, attaining profound and vast wisdom. <br> As soon as he was released from prison in 1979, Garchen Rinpoche took it upon himself to rebuild the Drikung Kagyu monasteries in Tibet, reestablish the Buddhist teachings, and build boarding schools for local children. <br> Garchen Rinpoche first came to the West in 1997. He is founder and spiritual director of the Garchen Buddhist Institute, in Arizona, and other Dharma centers in the United States, and spiritual director of many centers in North America, Asia, and Europe. He widely promotes Tokme Zangpo's <i>Thirty-Seven Practices of a Bodhisattva</i>. <br> Now in his late seventies, Garchen Rinpoche is revered throughout the world by people of all traditions and walks of life, for his extraordinary love, limitless compassion, and clear wisdom. After decades of tireless travel, bringing Dharma to countless people, Rinpoche is now residing at his Western seat, the Garchen Buddhist Institute.In this book you will find instructions that come straight from the heart, based on direct experience, so it is not an ordinary academic piece of literature.

It presents vases not merely as beautiful vessels to hold water and wine, but also as instruments of storytelling and bearers of meaning.<br><br>The first two chapters analyze the development of different shapes of pottery and relate those shapes to function, the evolution in vase production techniques and decoration, and the roles of potters, painters, and their workshops. Subsequent chapters focus on vases as the primary source of imagery from ancient Greece, offering unique information about mythology, religion, theater, and daily life. The author discusses how to identify the figures and scenes depicted in vase paintings, what these narratives would have meant to the people who lived with them and used them, and how they therefore reflect the cultural values of their time. Also examined is the impact Greek vases had on the art, architecture, and literature of subsequent generations.<br><br>Based on the rich collections of the British Museum and the J.

David Yarrow travels from pole to pole and continent to continent to visit frozen Arctic tundras, vast African deserts, primordial rain forests, and remote villages, inviting us to truly connect with subjects we mistakenly think we have seen before. Yarrow takes the familiar&#x2014;lions, elephants, tigers, polar bears&#x2014;and makes it new again by creating iconic images that deliberately connect with us at a highly emotional level. &nbsp;For more than two decades, this legendary wildlife photographer has been putting himself in harm's way to capture the most unbelievable close-up animal photography, amassing an incomparable photographic portfolio, spanning six continents. Driven by a passion for sharing and preserving Earth's last great wild cultures and species, Yarrow is as much a conservationist as a photographer and artist. His work has transcended wildlife photography and is now collected and shown as fine art in some of the most famed galleries around the world. Featuring 160 of his most breathtaking photographs, <i>Wild Encounters</i> offers a truly intimate view of some of the world's most compelling&#x2014;and threatened&#x2014;species and captures the splendor and very soul of what remains wild and free in our world through portraits that feel close enough to touch.</p><p><b>David Yarrow</b> was born in Scotland and is now based in London. He was named Young Scottish Photographer of the Year at the age of 20, and since turning his lens on the natural world, David has built an unrivaled reputation for capturing the beauty of the planet's remote landscapes and endangered animals. He is now Europe's best-selling wildlife photographer and is represented by a selection of the world's leading galleries while also being appointed as an ambassador for Nikon UK.&nbsp; <b>Tusk</b>, whose Royal Patron is <b>HRH The Duke of Cambridge</b>, will receive proceeds from the sale of the book to support its vital conservation projects in Africa.

Since its formation in 1990, Tusk has invested more than&nbsp;$40 million&nbsp;into a wide range of projects&nbsp;across the continent."<b>David Yarrow is one of the virtuosos of black and white wildlife photography.&nbsp;</b> His art has graced galleries from Europe to North America. In this large format, portfolio-sized book, you&#x2019;ll be treated to some of his finest work. Arranged by the latitude of locale, his dramatic monochromatic photographs of wild and endangered animals appear to leap from the page. Some of the most powerful images are tightly framed close-ups in which almost every hair of the animal can be seen. The emphasis of the book is on wildlife, but he also features people who live in close proximity with the creatures he photographs, and included among those are stunning portrayals of the Inuit in northern Canada and the stately Dinka people of the South Sudan. You won&#x2019;t be disappointed. <b>This is truly the work of an artist at the height of his powers.</b>"<br> &#x2014;2017 National Outdoor Book Award Winner<br><br>"Best art and photography book of 2016." <br>&#x2014;<i>Amazon.com</i><br><br>"Holiday Gift Pick 2016"<br>&#x2014;<i>Entertainment Weekly&nbsp;</i><br><br>"His book '<i>Wild Encounters</i>' from New York&#x2019;s Rizzoli publishing house was released last month and <b>features work from seven continents with images of some of earth&#x2019;s most-endangered species</b>."<br><i>&#x2014;Shutterbug Magazine<br><br></i>"Certainly, <i>Wild Encounters</i> is more than up-close wildlife photography, even though that is what stands out. . . .

His goal with the book, as with much of his work, was to push beyond the staid one-dimensional portraits that can be common with wildlife photography. The result is a triumph of both artistic mastery and emotional affect&#x2014;a portfolio of compelling, visually arresting pictures that afford us the opportunity to fully grasp both the magnificence of animals in the wild, and the threats they face in a modern world."<br>&#x2014;<i> Sierra Magazine</i><br><br>"The haunting image of a female lion staring out from the cover of <b><i>Wild Encounters: Iconic Photographs of the World&#x2019;s Vanishing Animals and Cultures</i></b> (Rizzoli, $75) conveys the immediacy of this volume of 160 photographs of the most vulnerable species and cultures around the world. Renowned wildlife photographer David Yarrow offers stunning and intimate images of elephants, lions, tigers, and bears in their native habitats across six continents, pulled from his two decades of experience in the field. This book clearly is driven by the author&#x2019;s passion for conservation and highlights the real risks to the continued survival of these animals and their place on the planet.

Alphabetically arranged for ease of reference, it offers biographical entries on some 1,500 individual poets, as well as over one hundred entries covering important magazines, movements, literary terms and concepts.<br> As readable as it is comprehensive, the <em>Companion</em> offers a fascinating survey of this century's shift from 'poetry' to 'poetries,' as American and British traditions of poetry have made way for a growing diversity of voices, and as the burgeoning poetries of Australia, Canada, and other English-speaking countries assert their own identities. The range of poets represented in this <em>Companion</em> is extraordinary. Here are in-depth discussions of Yeats, Eliot, Pound, and Joyce alongside provocative assessments of W.H. Auden, Elizabeth Bishop, Wallace Stevens, and Marianne Moore. John Ashbery, Margaret Atwood, Maya Angelou, and Mary Oliver are accounted for, as well as Carolyn Forch�, David Bottoms, Jorie Graham, and many other younger poets just coming into prominence. Chinua Achebee, Jack Mapanje, Femi Oyebode and other important African poets writing in English are here, as well as poets from the Caribbean, India, and even Russia.<br> Readers will relish this <em>Companion's</em> many insightful contributions from celebrated poet-critics, writing on other poets in intriguing author-subject combinations. For example, Seamus Heaney writes on Robert Lowell ("Lowell had invented a way of getting at life, of making poetry kick and freak at the edge of contemporary reality"), Ann Stevenson discusses Sylvia Plath ("In the quarter-century following her suicide, Sylvia Plath has become a heroine and martyr of the feminist movement. In fact, she was a martyr mainly to the recurrent psychodrama that staged itself within the bell jar of her tragically wounded personality"), and Tom Paulin weighs in on Ted Hughes ("His appointment as Poet Laureate in 1984 sealed his essentially shaman-like conception of his poetic mission and enabled him to speak out on environmental issues while celebrating royal weddings and babies"). Other pairings include Jay Parini on Wallace Stevens, Jon Stallworthy on Wilfred Owen and Rupert Brook, and William H. Pritchard on Robert Frost and Randall Jarrell. Each entry includes a wealth of biographical and bibliographical information, and a select bibliography at the end of the book supplies a handy source of information on poets whose work is not otherwise in print, or readily available to readers.<br> From Abse and Auden to Zaturenska and Zukofsky, <em>The Oxford Companion to Twentieth-Century Poetry in English</em> is an essential reference for students, lovers of poetry, and for poets themselves.<br></p><p>This Companion is both an alphabetically arranged reference work and, in its sum, a history, a map of modern poetry in English. From the last decade of the century, it offers a survey of the terrain, from 1900 to the present, and from Britain and America to New Zealand, Pakistan, Singapore, Trinidad, Zimbabwe - anywhere, in fact, where poets write in English. It charts the shift from &#39;poetry&#39; to &#39;poetries&#39; - from primarily British and American traditions to a rich diversity of younger poetic identities elsewhere. The only comprehensive work of its kind, it covers not just individual poets - some 1,500 of them - but also magazines, movements, concepts, and critical terms. Edited and introduced by Ian Hamilton, himself a notable poet, The Oxford Companion to Twentieth-Century Poetry in English has the distinction of including among its contributors many other celebrated poet-critics, often in intriguing author/subject combinations. For example, Tom Paulin writes on Ted Hughes, Christopher Reid on Elizabeth Bishop, Clive Wilmer on Ezra Pound, Jon Stallworthy on Rupert Brooke, Peter Porter on Lawrence Durrell, Seamus Heancy on Robert Lowell, Femi Oyebode on Jack Mapanje, and Anne Stevenson on Sylvia Plath. These and other writers offer lively and opinionated critical assessments as well as biographical and bibliographical information. And, as one soon discovers, twentieth-century poets have lived far from humdrum lives. Twenty-seven here had nervous breakdowns, nineteen served time in jail, fourteen died in battle, three were murdered, one executed. One played hockey for his country. There were fifteen suicides, and one poet who staged his own death only to reappear, still writing poetry, under a new name. From Abse and Auden to Zaturenska and Zukofsky, this is an essential work of reference for students, lovers of poetry, and for poets themselves.<br>The author of several books of poetry, <strong>Ian Hamilton</strong> is also a well-known biographer whose subjects have included Robert Lowell and J. D. Salinger. <em>Keepers of the Flame</em>, a collection of his literary criticism, was published in 1992.<br></p><h2>Painted Prayers: Women&#39;s Art in Village India</h2><p>For hundreds of years, Indian women have passed to their daughters the knowledge of the ritual wall and ground paintings and decorations of the home that function as messages to the deities for the health and well-being of Indian families. Some ground paintings are daily rituals, made every morning at dawn, while wall paintings and mud bas-reliefs are often made for special festivals to honor the deities and attract their benevolent attentions. It is the women of India who are responsible for communication with the gods on behalf of their families, governing the activities of family members, and maintaining the sanctity and order of the home.<br>Painted Prayers is a fascinating account of the centuries-old artistic traditions of women in village India, set forth in 170 full-color photographs that evoke the women's rich artistic heritage, and the pride and pleasure with which they regard their creative responsibilities. The knowledgeable text details the traditions, rituals, and beliefs behind this little-known art form and places this art in the context of contemporary Indian women's lives and the social realities of India today.<br>This book is a splendid gallery of this diverse aspect of Indian art and a pictorial tour of the India travelers rarely see. Designs vary between the representational and the purely graphic: painted and sculpted images such as mounds of rice are drawn from local iconography, while elephants, peacocks and lotus blooms are symbols of the deities. Colors ranging from earth tones to reds, blues, yellow, green, and white make the designs stand out from the mud-covered walls and dusty streets, a vibrant testament to centuries of Indian women's artistic voices.</p><p>Stephen P.

J. H. Elliott, one of the most distinguished and versatile historians working today, offers us history on a grand scale, contrasting the worlds built by Britain and by Spain on the ruins of the civilizations they encountered and destroyed in North and South America.<br>Elliott identifies and explains both the similarities and differences in the two empires&#x2019; processes of colonization, the character of their colonial societies, their distinctive styles of imperial government, and the independence movements mounted against them. Based on wide reading in the history of the two great Atlantic civilizations, the book sets the Spanish and British colonial empires in the context of their own times and offers us insights into aspects of this dual history that still influence the Americas.<br><br></p><p><b>J.

Lawhead helps students retrace the philosopher&#39;s intellectual journey rather than simply giving a report of the results so that the students see how the problems arose. Thus the philosopher&#39;s problem becomes a puzzle which the student has to face. Lawhead uses metaphors, analogies, vivid images, concrete examples, common experiences, and diagrams to bring the abstract issues down to earth and show the practical implications and contemporary relevance of positions.</p><p>William Lawhead received a Ph.D. in philosophy from the University of Texas.

Leaving England for America, she pursued a career as an investigative reporter and unrepentant gadfly, publicizing not only the misdeeds of, most famously, the funeral business (<i>The American Way of Death</i>, a bestseller) and the prison business (<i>Kind and Usual Punishment</i>), but also of writing schools and weight-loss programs. Mitford&#x2019;s diligence, unfailing skepticism, and acid pen made her one of the great chroniclers of the mischief people get up to in the pursuit of profit and the name of good.&nbsp;<i>Poison Penmanship&nbsp;</i>collects seventeen of Mitford&#x2019;s finest pieces&#x2014;about everything from crummy spas to network-TV&nbsp;censorship&#x2014;and fills them out with the story of how she got the scoop and, no less fascinating, how the story developed after publication. The book is a delight to read: few journalists have ever been as funny as Mitford, or as gifted at getting around in those dark, cobwebbed corners where modern America fashions its shiny promises. It&#x2019;s also an unequaled and necessary manual of the fine art of investigative reporting.</p></p><p><p><br>Jessica Mitford (1917&#x2013;1996) was the daughter of Lord and Lady Redesdale, and she and her five sisters and one brother grew up in isolation on their parents&#x2019; Cotswold estate. Rebelling against her family&#x2019;s hidebound conservatism, Mitford became an outspoken socialist and, with her second cousin and husband-to-be Esmond Romilly, ran away to fight against Franco in the Spanish Civil War. Romilly was killed in World War II, and Mitford moved to America, where she married the lawyer and political activist Robert Treuhaft. A brilliant muckraking journalist, Mitford was the author of, among other works, a memoir of her youth, <i>Hons and Rebels </i>(also published as an NYRB Classic); a study of the funeral industry, <i>The American Way of Death</i>; and <i>Kind and Unusual Punishment: The Prison Business</i>. She died at the age of seventy-eight while working on a follow-up to <i>The American Way of Death</i>, for which, with characteristic humor, she proposed the title &#x201c;<i>Death Warmed Over</i>.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><i><br></i><br> Jane Smiley, <b>winner of the 1992 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, is the author of many novels and other works. In 2010 she published <i>Private Life</i>, a novel; <i>A Good Horse</i>, a book for young adults; and <i>The Man Who Invented the Computer</i>, the first volume of the Sloane American Inventors series.<br></b></p><p>&#x201c;There is something rather fine about Mitford's tireless pursuit of her quarries, who include undertakers on the make, publishers peddling phony creative writing courses and the hapless bureaucrats she encounters during a brief and stormy spell as a professor..... These are articles written with a keen eye for injustice, but also with a great sense of personal passion, and a generous, exuberant wit.&#x201d; &#x2014;Lettie Ransley, <i>The Observer</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;...an exuberant enjoyment of the "Gentle Art of Muckraking" driven both by a hunger for justice and a love of the absurd.... Most collections of journalistic pieces barely warrant being bound in book form: this one (from 1979), with its wit and irrepressible ebullience, genuinely makes a convincing "classic" of a sort.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The Scotsman</i><br><br>"For my part, I can't remember when I enjoyed a collection of journalism so much, or laughed out loud so often. &nbsp;&nbsp;Spirited, extremely witty and sharp and, perhaps most importantly, driven by a powerful sense of social justice, Mitford was, quite simply, one of the most useful journalists of the 20th century. That she could also make you laugh while exposing the shenanigans of the corrupt, or, as she preferred to call it, muckraking, makes this book indispensable....It is also useful as, and intended to be useful as, a manual for doing the kind of journalism she did. She is very interested in inspiring people to continue the tradition of muckraking, and just because the technology of journalism has changed, it doesn't mean that techniques of getting interviewees to spill beans they would otherwise have preferred unspilled have changed, too. So as well as comments, or post-mortems, on every piece here, there is also an entertaining and helpful introduction in which she goes through the basics of her trade...And you can learn so much from her style, too.&nbsp;Although, it has to be said, there would be many at the receiving end of her attention who would dispute that line about her sweet nature. But then it was always her business to afflict the comfortable and comfort the afflicted. Never mind if you haven't read any of her more substantial works (<i>The American Way of Death, Kind and Unusual Punishment</i>); here, in essence, is her achievement."

He has also edited encyclopedias of world and social history, and since 1967, he has served as editor-in-chief of <i>The Journal of Social History. </i>In most of his research and writing, Dr. Stearns pursues three main goals. First, as a social historian, he is eager to explore aspects of the human experience that are not generally thought of in historical terms, and with attention to ordinary people as well as elites. Second, he seeks to use an understanding of historical change and continuity to explore patterns of behavior and social issues. Finally, he is concerned with connecting new historical research with wider audiences, including of course classrooms. Dr. Stearns is also eager to promote comparative analysis and the assessment of modern global forces&#x2014;for their own sake and as they illuminate the American experience and impact.</p><p>&#x201c;This is a high quality, affordable text that has very strong instructor resources.&#x201d;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>-Kristopher Treat, Arizona State University</i> </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&#x201c;I...really appreciate the instructor's manual and the way the book highlights themes and key questions.

A collection like this deserves wide reading; it raises many intriguing questions for historians and for all those in the health fields.&#34; &#34;This intriguing and informative volume contains twenty-six papers presented before a Conference on American Folk Medicine held in 1973. The papers range in time from the dawn of consciousness to present, most treating recent and contemporary practices; in geography from Canada to South America, most centering within the United States; in cultural group from Amish to Cajun to Jamaican to Mexican American, the largest single category focusing on American Indian medicine; in theme from the madstone to the mole, from the birthmark to the balmyard, the variety too rich to credit properly here.&#34; &#34;Until the publication of this book, no attempt had been made to provide the student of folk medicine with a collection of diverse approaches to topics in the discipline. This is a seminal work within the realm of the major genre of folklore, and might well be understood as being a useful mirror of contemporary folkloristics.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>The Country House Library</h2><p>Beginning with new evidence that cites the presence of books in Roman villas and concluding with present day vicissitudes of collecting, this generously illustrated book presents a complete survey of British and Irish country house libraries.

The author also disputes the notion that these libraries were merely for show, arguing that many of them were profoundly scholarly, assembled with meticulous care, and frequently used for intellectual pursuits.

Over a quarter of a century she is repeatedly victimized by circumstance, temperament, and most particularly the fact of her sex. Yet the triumph of the book lies in her incorrigibly loving nature. Cast out by society as well as by her family, she none the less fosters a far deeper understanding of relationships than anyone else.

In recent years, there has been increased awareness of the seriousness of these struggles, which may increase the risk of psychological distress and mental illness among this age group now commonly referred to as 'emerging adults.' Scientific research has shown that practicing mindfulness can help manage stress and enhance quality of life, but traditional methods of teaching mindfulness and meditation are not always effective for this developmental stage.<br><br><em>Mindfulness for the Next Generation </em>is an easy-to-use guide that details a four-session mindfulness-based program, called 'Koru,' aimed at helping young adults cope with anxiety, navigate the tasks they face, and achieve meaningful personal growth.

And if so, how do you interpret the word?"<br><br>In responding to this question, eight iconoclastic thinkers prove the rich potential of democracy, along with its critical weaknesses, and reconceive the practice to accommodate new political and cultural realities. Giorgio Agamben traces the tense history of constitutions and their coexistence with various governments. Alain Badiou contrasts current democratic practice with democratic communism. Daniel Bensaid ponders the institutionalization of democracy, while Wendy Brown discusses the democratization of society under neoliberalism. Jean-Luc Nancy measures the difference between democracy as a form of rule and as a human end, and Jacques Ranci�re highlights its egalitarian nature. Kristin Ross identifies hierarchical relationships within democratic practice, and Slavoj Zizek complicates the distinction between those who desire to own the state and those who wish to do without it.<br><br>Concentrating on the classical roots of democracy and its changing meaning over time and within different contexts, these essays uniquely defend what is left of the left-wing tradition after the fall of Soviet communism. They confront disincentives to active democratic participation that have caused voter turnout to decline in western countries, and they address electoral indifference by invoking and reviving the tradition of citizen involvement. Passionately written and theoretically rich, this collection speaks to all facets of modern political and democratic debate.</p><p><b>Alain Badiou (Author) </b><br> Alain Badiou (PhD, Philosophy, Ecole Normale Superieure) holds the Rene Descartes Chair at the European Graduate School; he also teaches at the Ecole Normale Superieure and the College International de Philosophie in Paris.

Sam Spencer runs a plumbing supply business; Jane, his wife, teaches at a school for the learning disabled. On a typical day, their lives -- like the lives of most Americans -- are touched repeatedly by the world of nonprofit organizations. </p><p> * At 7:30 A.M., Jane takes Sammy, Jr., aged three, to a daycare center housed at the Baptist Church to which the family belongs. She then goes directly to her school, which serves learning-disabled high-school students. The daycare center, the church, and the school are all nonprofit organizations. </p><p> * At about the same time that Jane leaves, Sam is loading his truck with plumbing supplies for the regional hospital, which is located in their city. The hospital, which employs more than a thousand people, is also a nonprofit organization, one that makes a significant contribution to the local economy. </p><p> * Before leaving home, Sam reminds son John, aged nine, that he should pack his bathing suit and towel because there is swim practice after school at the local YMCA. The YMCA is the city's principal recreational organization and is organized as a nonprofit. </p><p> * On this particular day, Jane is on release time from the classroom taking an in-service workshop on language arts instruction at the local college. The college is the largest nonprofit organization in the city. </p><p> * While Jane is on release time, half of her students from school are on a field trip to the science museum and the other half are attending an open rehearsal at the local symphony. Both of these organizations are nonprofit organizations. </p><p> * Meanwhile, Sam has completed his delivery of plumbing supplies and drives over to the job-training center where he teaches the essentials of plumbing two mornings a week. Although supported almost exclusively with government funding, the center is a nongovernment, private nonprofit organization. </p><p> * When school is over, Jane meets with a group of teachers who are working on a special grant proposal that they will submit to a local foundation. They are seeking funds to support a computer-based language arts program in their classrooms. The foundation, whose income is derived mainly from a large endowment and is exempt from taxation, is a nonprofit organization. </p><p> * After leaving school, Jane drives over to a local nursing home to visit her father. The nursing home is a nonprofit organization. </p><p> * Sam leaves work early to go to a public hearing. A local builder, one of Sam's customers, has proposed a new development in what was formerly marshland. An environmental group, organized as a nonprofit organization, is opposing the development and is presenting its testimony at the public hearing. </p><p> * When Jane arrives home, there is a letter from daughter Amy, who is spending the fall of her junior year in South America as part of an exchange program. The exchange was organized by a national nonprofit organization with a local chapter in the city where the Spencers live. </p><p> * Finally, after dinner, the Spencers receive a call from the public radio station. It is pledge week and the caller asks whether the Spencers will renew their membership in this nonprofit organization. Jane leaves soon after for a planning meeting for the local Girl Scouts' cookie drive. The Girl Scouts is a prominent national nonprofit organization. </p><p> There are over a million nonprofit organizations in the United States, a number that has increased over 25 percent in the past quarter century. They range from large universities with assets in the billions of dollars to small all-volunteer, community-based, grass roots organizations that seem to operate on a shoestring. Though they represent less than 5 percent of all institutions and they own only 2 percent of the nation's assets, their contribution to the nation's quality of life is incalculable. They contribute hundreds of billions of dollars to the nation's economy and employ over 15 million people. On a per capita basis, Americans contribute nearly $300 per year of their own personal money to nonprofits plus substantially more in contributed hours. In fact, at the end of the twentieth century, nearly one hundred million Americans (and almost 50 percent of the adult population) volunteered their time to nonprofit organizations with an estimated value of over $200 billion. </p><p> Despite the tremendous size and impact of the nonprofit sector, it is not well understood by most people. The purpose of this chapter is to describe what nonprofit organizations are, what distinctive features they possess, and what special challenges they pose for the people who manage and govern them. </p><p> <b>WHAT IS A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION?</b> </p><p> Suppose you asked someone, "What is an elephant?" and the person answered, "An elephant is a nonhorse." You would probably find the answer unsatisfactory. Yet, the term nonprofit organization describes something that is not something else -- it suggests a business enterprise not organized to make a profit. But it tells us very little about the essential characteristics of this type of entity. </p><p> It is not easy to describe nonprofit organizations and this is partly what makes managing them such a difficult task fraught with challenges and problems. Unlike management issues in the profit sector, which tend to be clear and related to specific economic measures, issues in the nonprofit environment are more nebulous because they relate to the somewhat abstract concept of <i>public service.</i> In a profit-making company, a manager generally knows whether he or she is doing a good job, but it is often less clear in a nonprofit organization in which the primary purpose is not to make money but to serve the public. </p><p> Some say that the essential defining characteristic of nonprofit organizations is the fact that they are established to provide a service to the public, and to some extent this is true. But this idea of a public service mission can be misleading. For one thing, there are a number of nonprofit organizations that are not organized to serve the public (for example, country clubs and labor unions). For another, the idea that nonprofit organizations are simply organized to solve some societal problem or deliver some much-needed public service flies in the face of the exclusivity often associated with their respective constituencies. This is perhaps most clear when nonprofit organizations are compared to public (or government) organizations and agencies working in the same field. Although the nonprofit organizations often have a stated public service mission, they do not necessarily have a requirement of equity (that is, a mandate to serve everyone) the way public agencies usually do. As a result, the nonprofit organization's actual constituency may be far more limited than that of a public agency working in the same field. </p><p> Others claim that the essential defining characteristic of nonprofit organizations is that their mission is not to make money. Again, this is partly true. But many nonprofit organizations are quite entrepreneurial (again, this distinguishes them from public or governmental agencies working in the same field). Many engage in all sorts of money-making ventures that bear a close resemblance to profit-making entities and this has been cause for some concern among those working in commercial endeavors whose businesses must compete with nonprofits for customers. </p><p> In fact, a nonprofit organization is neither in the profit sector nor in the public sector but sits somewhere between the two. This position allows the nonprofit great flexibility in its operation but also requires great skill in its management. On the one hand, managers must learn the same management techniques and analytical strategies that apply in profit-making companies. However, while these techniques are relevant in the nonprofit world, their application is dissimilar. Although both profit-making and nonprofit organizations engage in planning, budgeting, accounting, and marketing; although both have to contend with issues of governance, personnel, and information management; and although both have to raise money from time to time, these activities are carried out in markedly different ways. Similarly, while it maybe useful to know about the workings of a public agency and the development of public policy, it is not sufficient preparation for the nonprofit manager or trustee. Governance, organizational accountability, financial reporting, and long-range planning are very different in nonprofit organizations whose special defining characteristics are laid down in state and federal law. </p><p> <b>Toward a Definition</b> </p><p> In this book, the term <i>nonprofit organization</i> refers to those legally constituted, nongovernmental entities incorporated under state law as charitable or not-for-profit corporations that have been set up to serve some public purpose and are tax-exempt according to the IRS. All must have the following five characteristics: </p><p> * They must have a public service mission<br> * They must be organized as a not-for-profit or charitable corporation<br> * Their governance structures must preclude self-interest and private financial gain<br> * They must be exempt from paying federal tax<br> * They must possess the special legal status that stipulates gifts made to them are tax deductible </p><p> Consequently, nonprofit organizations <i>as described in this book</i> do <i>not</i> include three other categories of organizations: </p><p> * Entities that have been set up to make a profit but are failing to do so<br> * Organizations that are governed informally by a collection of people who, although they have banded together to serve some public good, have been granted no special corporate status by federal and state authorities<br> * Organizations that are recognized as nonprofit by the IRS but do not have a public purpose (for example, trade associations, labor unions, country clubs, and fraternal organizations) </p><p> Because these various classes of organizations do not have <i>all</i> the characteristics previously listed, their missions, governance structures, or method of management may be significantly different from what is described in this book. </p><p> This chapter considers four major challenges that face nonprofit organizations as a consequence of these special characteristics. The challenges are: </p><p> * Articulating a clear public service mission<br> * Engaging in risk/survival analysis<br> * Identifying and involving the constituency<br> * Testing for "Organized Abandonment" </p><p> By looking closely at each of these, we will continue to refine our understanding of the special nature of nonprofit organizations. </p><p> <b>CONSEQUENCES OF A PUBLIC SERVICE MISSION</b> </p><p> An essential difference between profit and nonprofit organizations centers on the concept of mission. The ultimate mission of the profit-making entity is to earn money for its owners. Ownership can come in many forms, of course, from outright ownership of the organization by a single individual to shared ownership (by partners or shareholders or some other group). The concept of <i>ownership</i> is completely absent from nonprofit organizations and consequently the nonprofit's mission has a totally different thrust. There can be no owners in a nonprofit organization because such an entity is intended to serve a broad public purpose and the law is clear in specifying that ownership (with concomitant private gain) is incompatible with public purpose. This is not to say that nonprofit organizations cannot make money. Nonprofit organizations can and do make money -- in the same way profit-making entities do -- but the money that is taken in must be directed toward the public purpose for which the organization was set up, held in-reserve, or turned over to another organization with a public purpose. </p><p> It is much more difficult to identify and articulate the mission of a nonprofit organization and consequently to develop criteria by which success can be measured. In a profit-making organization, because the mission is clear, success criteria are also clear. The mission centers around profitability; thus the criteria for success (and for decision making) include the bottom line, return on investment, sales, profit margins, market share, and other easily calculated measures. In a nonprofit organization, where the mission centers around public service, it is not only more difficult to define purposes but it can be a bewildering task to try to find the proper yardstick by which to measure success. If the purpose of a school is to produce well-educated citizens, if a peace group is established to oppose the use of military force in Latin America, if a recreation center is to offer constructive activities to urban teenagers, what criteria should each use to measure success? There will always be quantitative measures at hand -- college board scores for the school, statistics on attendance at political rallies for the peace group, and numbers of participating teenagers in the case of the recreation center -- but these measures are only indirect indexes of success. </p><p> Because the missions of nonprofit organizations center on the concept of public service, one might look to the public sector for models that demonstrate how mission statements are articulated and tested. Unfortunately, there is a problem with this approach. In the public sector, as we have already seen, there is an implied or stated mandate of equity in every mission statement. That is, public agencies are obligated to serve anyone who is eligible for assistance. For that reason, quantitative measures of success are often possible on the basis of the numbers of people served, their geographic distribution, their racial and socioeconomic diversity, and the cost-effectiveness of service delivery. For nonprofit organizations, these criteria may be relevant, but more often than not they are only indirect measures of success. Consider a nonprofit university-affiliated teaching hospital. Unlike the public hospital down the street, it cannot directly measure its success by counting the numbers of patients served and the cost-effectiveness of medical treatment. The nonprofit hospital's mission of promoting excellence in medical practice through exemplary training is less concrete, and success criteria are more difficult to establish. </p><p> Thus we come to the first major challenge for a nonprofit organization -- the challenge of articulating a clear public service mission. The challenge is not only to come up with a statement that defines what the organization is and what it has been set up to do but to state these things in such a way that the organization can evaluate its success in carrying out this mission over time. </p><p> <b>Developing a Mission Statement</b> </p><p> The challenge of developing a good mission statement is to create a text that is sufficiently broad to encompass the many possible activities that the organization may wish to engage in. This is crucial inasmuch as the law obligates the trustees of the organization to limit their activities to those covered by the mission statement as contained in the organizing charter.

Surrounded by the museum's elaborate, naturalistic dioramas, Sugimoto realized that the scenes jumped to life when looked at with one eye closed. Recreated forestry and stretches of uninhabited land, wild, crouching animals against painted backgrounds and even prehistoric humans seemed entirely convincing with this visual trick, which launched a conceptual exploration of the photographic medium that has traversed his entire career. Focusing his camera on individual dioramas as though they were entirely surrounding scenes, omitting their frames and educational materials and ensuring that no reflections enter the shot, his subjects appear as if photographed in their natural habitats. He also explores the power of photography to create history--in his own words, "photography functions as a fossilization of time." <i>Hiroshi Sugimoto: Dioramas</i> narrates a story of the cycle of life, death and rebirth, from prehistoric aquatic life to the propagation of reptile and animal life to <i>Homo sapiens</i>' destruction of the earth, circling back to its renewal, where flora and fauna flourish without man. Here Sugimoto writes his own history of the world, an artist's creation myth.<br><br><b>Hiroshi Sugimoto</b> was born and raised in Tokyo, Japan, where he studied politics and sociology at Rikky� University, later retraining as an artist at the Art Center College of Design in Los Angeles, CA. He currently lives in New York and Tokyo.</p><p>Born in Tokyo in 1948, Sugimoto left Japan in 1970 after graduating fromRikkyo University with a degree in economics. He traveled throughoutthe Soviet Union and Europe and then moved to Los Angeles, wherehe studied photography at the Art Center College of Design. His workhas been exhibited internationally in group and solo shows, and hewas the recipient of the Hasselblad Foundation International Award inPhotography in 2001 and the Mainichi Art Prize in 1988. He currently livesin New York and Tokyo.Don&#x2019;t let the ease and beauty of Sugimoto&#x2019;s images fool you. Before you get the idea that you, too, can waltz into your local natural history museum and take photos like this, understand the painstaking amount of craft in each shot. Sugimoto captures his scenes with a large format camera and long exposures sometimes five minutes in length. He adjusts lights and whatever else necessary to bring the taxidermy to life&#x2015;so successfully that the line between real and fake is often blurred. (Alyssa Coppelman <i>wired.com</i>)<br><br>A Canadian lynx in fake snow, Alaskan brown bears towering over painted backdrops, and Cro-Magnon families building homes out of bones all appear in Hiroshi Sugimoto: Dioramas (Damiani, $65), which features highlights from those museum visits. Sugimoto continues to take diorama photos today, fascinated, as he writes, by the way they 'present us with something simultaneously dead and alive.' (T. Fleischmann <i>Publisher's Weekly</i>)<br><br>Perhaps the darkness struck me more than usual on a recent visit to the museum because I had just been looking at Hiroshi Sugimoto&#x2019;s new book, Dioramas, a collection of his elegant black and white photographs of dioramas, many of which were taken at the Museum of Natural History.<p></p>Sugimoto uses long exposures, and the feeling I got from his work is just that: of observing something being exposed, something normally hidden, buried, and the uneasy sense that perhaps it was meant to remain hidden, undisturbed. The book with its smaller images is less intense. It&#x2019;s harder to decipher the surprises and ambiguities in the photographs, but they&#x2019;re there. The image on the cover of Dioramas is Sugimoto&#x2019;s photograph of the polar bear looming above a seal that lies, oblong and fat, beside a crack in the pure white ice. The other day, a guest saw the book in my living room and said, &#x201c;Oh, cute!&#x201d; then, a quick double take as he noticed the droplets of blood: &#x201c;Oh... dead.&#x201d; (Cathleen Schine <i>The New York Review of Books</i>)<br><br>A study in dioramas four decades in the making, Sugimoto's photographs explore the stylized reality of museum-made habitats and what they reveal about nature and the power of photography to document the natural world. (Phil Bicker <i>Time Lightbox</i>)<br><br>The Japanese photographer&#x2019;s enormous black-and-white landscapes were made between 1976 and 2012 at natural-history museums. Their subjects are dioramas, displaying taxidermy animals and fake foliage against painted backdrops&#x2015;dense layers of artifice, to which Sugimoto&#x2019;s photographs add yet another layer. Like so much of the artist&#x2019;s work, this series is conceptually brilliant, formally impressive, and ice cold. Which might be the point: we&#x2019;re so alienated from nature that even the dioramas staged to involve us in animal drama (warthog vs. ostrich, polar bear vs. seal) come off as empty, if elaborate, tableaux.

They emphasize the importance of movement as a means of communication, particularly unconscious or 'authentic' movement, emerging when the individual has a deep, self-sensing awareness - an attitude of 'inner listening'. Such movement can trigger powerful images, feelings and kinesthetic sensations arising from the depths of our stored childhood memories or connecting our inner selves to the transcendent.</p><p>In exploring Authentic Movement these questions are asked:</p><p>- How does authentic movement differ from other forms of dance and movement therapy?</p><p>- How may 'authentic' movement be experienced?</p></p><p>Patrizia Pallaro holds a doctorate in Clinical Psychology from the University of Padua in Italy and an MA in Dance/Movement Therapy from UCLA.

Antecedent based interventions -- an evidence-based practice -- can help children with sensory challenges. International Book Award Winner Arnie and His School Tools: Simple Sensory Solutions to Build Success is an illustrated children&#39;s book about an exuberant little boy who had difficulty paying attention in class and doing his school work until he is given the tools to accommodate his sensory needs. Written from Arnie&#39;s point of view, the book uses simple language to describe some of the sensory tools and strategies he uses at school and home to help him achieve a more optimal level of alertness and performance. Arnie and His School Tools creates an environment that is accepting of students with sensory difficulties, including many on the autism spectrum. Occupational therapists, teachers and parents will find this book an engaging way to introduce elementary students to basic sensory tools used to help children focus in classroom settings, such as fidgets, chewy pencil toppers, and weighted vests. Additional resources are provided at the end of the book, including definitions of sensory processing and sensory modulation disorder, suggested discussion questions, and lists of related books and websites.</p><p>Jennifer Veenendall is a school-based occupational therapist in West St. Paul, Minnesota.

Tell a person who is in the business of teaching business ethics, and the response is more likely to be, "Why add another one to the field?" </p> <p> There are many excellent books on the topic of ethics in business. Some of those books are written by professionals (i.e., professors of ethics or business) for professionals. Some are written by professionals for laypeople. Some are written by laypeople for fellow laypeople. And some books are written for students in courses on business ethics. </p> <p> <i>Ethics at Work</i> is written for readers who are, or may expect to be, in the business world. It presumes that the readers will not have previously taken an ethics course. In that sense, it is <i>introductory.</i> This book aims to provide the reader with material (ideas, manners of reasoning, ways of looking at things&#x2014;"tools," if you will) that will assist him or her in making ethical decisions, and becoming a better person. </p> <p> Not that this book will make good guys out of bad guys. No ethics book can do that on its own. Golf lessons for someone who doesn't care about playing golf won't accomplish much either. But, if the reader comes to this book with the willingness to improve his or her ability to live and act ethically in an often complex and challenging work environment, then this book should help&#x2014;it is meant to help&#x2014;in achieving that goal. </p> <p> Given the target audience of this book, certain choices were made regarding its style and format. </p> <ul> <li>Every attempt was made to present the material in a reader-friendly manner. I have tried to meet the readers where they are&#x2014;at least where I think they are&#x2014;rather than to ask, or require, them to enter into a special field of study with its own distinctive setting, structure, and terminology.</li> <li>This book is purposely short on names, dates, labels, and <i>-isms.</i> The reader will encounter some classical ethical viewpoints, to be sure, but the aim here is not to teach the <i>history</i> of ethics. Personally, I believe that names, dates, and labels will likely distract from the issues at hand, but reasonable people may disagree about that.</li> <li> <i>Ethics at Work</i> begins by considering a number of theoretical and meta-ethical issues (though it certainly doesn't say it that way), and then moves on both to normative ethics and to a version of virtue ethics. A companion work, the <i>Participant's Guide,</i> consists of scenarios and exercises that give readers the opportunity to put some of these concepts to work. It is not necessary, however, to use the two texts together. <i>Ethics at Work</i> itself contains both pre- and post-chapter questions that are meant to engage the reader with respect to the concepts that have been introduced.</li> <li>The book is full of questions. They occur at the beginning and end of each chapter. Moreover, under the rubric "Think About It," they appear throughout the chapters as well. The intent of the chapter "Warm-up" and "Think About It" questions is both to stimulate and to guide thinking. They are questions about the subject matter at hand, but not "about" it in the sense of being test questions to determine whether or not the reader has mastered the material. The "Wrap-up" questions at the end of each chapter do have correct or "best" answers, based on the content of the chapter. While they could be used as tests, their primary purpose is to help summarize key concepts within the chapters.</li> </ul> <p> A brief word is in order regarding the cartoons in this book. While there has been an attempt to locate them in chapters to which they might have a particular relevance, no one should push this idea too far. The cartoons do not necessarily support or reflect on a specific point of view under discussion. Please, don't ask what they mean or why they are there&#x2014;just enjoy them. They are for fun. The topic of ethics is serious business, but reading, studying, or talking about it need not be grim. </p> <p> <i>Ethics at Work</i> is based on the idea that business ethics involves applying general ethical principles to the particular and often complex situations that arise in business. This is a widely, but not universally, held view. There are those who would maintain that business ethics is, in some manner or other, sui generis&#x2014;that it is not just (<i>just!</i>) the application of general ethical principles to business situations. Certainly, an interesting debate can be carried on regarding this matter, but an introductory level book is not the proper venue for that debate. Nor is its preface. </p> <p> <i>Ethics at Work</i> avoids a particular ethical point of view. Yet one could always argue that the text does adopt a position&#x2014;the position Richard De George has called <i>moral pluralism.</i> The text presents many points of view through a summary of the analysis it does provide. </p> <p> The ethical approaches reviewed here all have strengths and weaknesses. None is perfect. So when you have a tough decision to make, you should look at it from a variety of perspectives (some of which you might not have considered before reading this book), and then you have to decide what is going to guide you in that situation. There's no guarantee that you will wind up doing the right thing. But it's more likely that you will, and you will certainly turn out to be a better person&#x2014;<i>because you tried to be</i>&#x2014;than if you had simply acted without reflection. </p> <p> If readers come away with a larger and better set of tools for making ethical decisions than they had before, and an increased willingness to use them, then this book will have succeeded. </p><p> "This book reassures the reader that ethical decisions require judgment (there is no recipe) and therefore are inherently messy . . . . Despite the inherent messiness, some ethical decisions are better than others and the choices affect who we are/become." &#x2014; Michael Moch </p> <p> "The style of this book is straightforward and easy to read." &#x2014; William Tita </p></p><h2>Response Surface Methodology: Process and Product Optimization Using Designed Experiments (Wiley Series in Probability and Statistics)</h2><p>Now updated and revised<br> From the reviews of the First Edition . . .<br> "Truly a book that can be read by practitioners...Anyone who deals with designing experiments, the statistical analysis and modeling of data, and especially product or process improvement, including optimization, should have this book as a reference."<br> -Technometrics<br> "An excellent book for practitioners.

Their book was among the first of the "modern" topically organized child development texts and provided students with an excellent overview of research in child development. In the twenty-five years since, researchers have made incredible progress in understanding children's development (and I'm proud to have been among those contributing). Unfortunately, authors have been overly enthusiastic about the emerging knowledge and textbooks have grown ever larger as more and more complex findings are added. As texts grew, my students complained to me that, with so much information in the book, they had difficulty separating the wheat from the chaff (an appropriate metaphor since I was teaching in the Midwestern United States). </p><p> Greater length and complexity was only part of the problem. Most textbook authors avoided effective pedagogy like the plague. They (along with many instructors) seemed to believe that students should be able to learn on their own, without relying on learning aids in the text. As a consequence, although child development texts still presented a valuable overview of the field, they were often ineffective tools for student learning. </p><p> In 1993, it seemed to me that a new book was needed&#x2014;one that would meet instructors' needs for a solid, research-oriented overview of the field but would also emphasize effective pedagogy designed to enhance students' learning. Children and Their Development, first published in 1998, is my effort to meet these goals. This book is traditional in its focus on research. The organization, too, is familiar: I begin with theories and methods, move to biological bases of child development, then describe cognitive development and, later, social-emotional development. Where this book begins to differ from the competition is length: it has about 100 fewer pages than most competing texts. To make the truly important child development work stand out for students, I have deliberately omitted some topics and described others relatively briefly. </p><p> But the focus on a student-friendly book is really evident in the way I've structured the chapters to help students learn about child development. I describe my approach in detail in Module 1.1, so I'll simply sketch it here. Each chapter consists of three or four modules that provide a clear and well-defined organization to the chapter. Each module begins with a set of learning objectives and a vignette that introduces the topic to be covered. Within each module, all figures, tables, and photos are fully integrated, eliminating the need for students to search for a graphic. Similarly, boxlike feature material that is set off in other textbooks is fully integrated with the main text and identified by a distinctive icon. Each module ends with several questions designed to help students check their understanding of the major ideas in the module. </p><p> The end of each chapter includes several additional study aids. "In Perspective" recaps each module, then links the ideas in the chapter to a major developmental theme. "See for Yourself" suggests activities that allow students to observe topics in child development firsthand. "Resources" includes books and Web sites where students can learn more about child development. "Key Terms" is a list of all of the important terms that appeared in the chapter. The "Summary" is organized by module and the primary headings within each module; it reviews the entire chapter. </p><p> Each module includes at least one feature where selected issues are highlighted. The four different kinds of features are "Focus on Research," "Making Children's Lives Better," "Cultural Influences;" and "Real Children:" The features are described in Module 1.1, but "Focus on Research" warrants extra attention here. Most textbooks describe research methods early on, then ignore them for the rest of the book. Children and Their Development takes a different and unique approach. In Module 1.3, I portray child development research as a dynamic process in which scientists make a series of decisions as they plan their work. In the process, they create a study that has both strengths and weaknesses. Each of the remaining chapters of the book contains a "Focus on Research" feature that illustrates this process by showing&#x2014;in a question-and-answer format&#x2014;the different decisions that investigators made in designing a particular study. I trace each of the steps and explain the decisions that were made. Then the results are shown&#x2014;usually with an annotated figure so that students can learn how to interpret graphs&#x2014;and the investigators' conclusions are described. Thus, the research methods that are introduced in Chapter 1 reappear in every chapter, in a setting that makes research come alive as a set of decisions that often involve compromises. (In my classes, I encourage students to think how the "Focus on Research" studies could be improved with different methods. At the same time, I ask them why the investigators might have resorted to the methods they did.) </p><p> The "Focus on Research" and other pedagogical elements are effective; students using the first edition commented that the book is easy to read and presents complex topics in an understandable way. Reading Children and Their Development, students come to appreciate both what we know about children's development and the research process that produced this knowledge. Changes to the Second Edition </p><p> In writing the second edition, I have included hundreds of new citations to research published in the past few years. I have also made significant additions to every chapter. Of particular note is the following new material:</p><p>Chapter 1 includes information on how to study and explains the rationale for the book's organization. Chapter 2 has material on methods from molecular genetics and two new major sections: one on pathways from genes to behavior and another on nonshared environmental influences. Chapter 3 contains a new section on postpartum depression and information about the national "Back to Sleep" campaign to combat SIDS. Chapter 4 now has information on sexual orientation, bulimia, and brain plasticity. Chapter 5 includes new material on object perception and the development of attention. Chapter 6 is reorganized to include two new modules, one that evaluates Piaget's theory and another that describes new approaches that complement Piaget's work. The latter module has a new section on "the child as a theorist." Chapter 7 now describes inhibitory processes, autobiographical memory, infantile amnesia, and writing. Chapter 8 contains new material on social intelligence and dynamic approaches to intelligence testing. Chapter 9 now begins with a new section defining different aspects of language and has an expanded section on fast mapping of meaning to words. Chapter 10 describes research on emotion regulation and work on adults' representations of their attachments with their own parents. Chapter 11 has a new "Focus on Research" feature on identity in children of transracial adoptions and a new section on the consequences of low self-esteem. Chapter 12 includes material that relates temperament to self-control, information on Kohlberg's Just Communities, and a new section dealing with victims of aggression. Chapter 13 describes social class and race differences in gender stereotypes and also includes information on gender differences in physical and relational aggression. Chapter 14 begins with a new section devoted to a systems approach to the study of the family and contains an expanded section on parental behaviors (with new material on direct instruction and coaching). Chapter 15 has much expanded coverage of peer relations, material on cross-sex friendships and factors that contribute to long-lasting friendships, a new section about TV as a medium (in addition to material about TV content), a largely new section on schools (organized around factors that make schools effective), and brand new material about adolescents' part-time employment.

In short, clients experience healing and begin to live satisfying lives.<br><br> Yvonne Dolan works from the assumption that, despite the traumas they have endured, clients have the inner resources to create uniquely effective solutions to their problems. Both solution-oriented and hypnotic techniques are used to tap those resources in the context of a safe, respectful relationship. Clients are encouraged to trust themselves, to move at their own right pace, and to recognize and build on tiny signs of healing.<br><br> Ericksonian techniques are particularly powerful in enabling clients to resolve dissociated traumatic experiences, experience corrective development learnings, and turn the symptom of dissociation into a resource for healing. Solution-focused therapy ensures that clients not only resolve past sexual abuse but also form a clear map of functional behaviors and perceptions to replace trauma-based ones.

Rather than obsessively going over the traumatic events of the past, both clients and supportive family members are guided to notice signs of improvement, to identify actions and words that are helpful, and to do more of what works.

Not that she minded being black, being a Negro necessitated having a colored skin, but she did mind being too black. She couldn't understand why such should be the case, couldn't comprehend the cruelty of the natal attenders who had allowed her to be dipped, as it were, in indigo ink when there were so many more pleasing colors on nature's palette. Biologically, it wasn't necessary either; her mother was quite fair, so was her mother's mother, and her mother's brother, and her mother's brother's son; but then none of them had had a black man for a father. Why <i>had</i> her mother married a black man? Surely there had been some eligible brown-skin men around. She didn't particularly desire to have had a "high yaller" father, but for her sake certainly some more happy medium could have been found.<br><br> She wasn't the only person who regretted her darkness either. It was an acquired family characteristic, this moaning and grieving over the color of her skin. Everything possible had been done to alleviate the unhappy condition, every suggested agent had been employed, but her skin, despite bleachings, scourgings, and powderings, had remained black&#x2014;fast black&#x2014;as nature had planned and effected.<br><br> She should have been a boy, then color of skin wouldn't have mattered so much, for wasn't her mother always saying that a black boy could get along, but that a black girl would never know anything but sorrow and disappointment? But she wasn't a boy; she was a girl, and color did matter, mattered so much that she would rather have missed receiving her high school diploma than have to sit as she now sat, the only odd and conspicuous figure on the auditorium platform of the Boise high school. Why had she allowed them to place her in the center of the first row, and why had they insisted upon her dressing entirely in white so that surrounded as she was by similarly attired pale-faced fellow graduates she resembled, not at all remotely, that comic picture her Uncle Joe had hung in his bedroom? The picture wherein the black, kinky head of a little red-lipped pickaninny lay like a fly in a pan of milk amid a white expanse of bedclothes.<br><br> But of course she couldn't have worn blue or black when the call was for the wearing of white, even if white was not complementary to her complexion. She would have been odd-looking anyway no matter what she wore and she would also have been conspicuous, for not only was she the only dark-skinned person on the platform, she was also the only Negro pupil in the entire school, and had been for the past four years. Well, thank goodness, the principal would soon be through with his monotonous farewell address, and she and the other members of her class would advance to the platform center as their names were called and receive the documents which would signify their unconditional release from public school.<br><br> As she thought of these things, Emma Lou glanced at those who sat to the right and to the left of her. She envied them their obvious elation, yet felt a strange sense of superiority because of her immunity for the moment from an ephemeral mob emotion. Get a diploma?&#x2014;What did it mean to her? College?&#x2014;Perhaps. A job?&#x2014;Perhaps again. She was going to have a high school diploma, but it would mean nothing to her whatsoever. The tragedy of her life was that she was too black. Her face and not a slender roll of ribbon-bound parchment was to be her future identification tag in society. High school diploma indeed! What she needed was an efficient bleaching agent, a magic cream that would remove this unwelcome black mask from her face and make her more like her fellow men.<br><br> "Emma Lou Morgan."<br><br> She came to with a start. The principal had called her name and stood smiling down at her benevolently. Some one&#x2014;she knew it was her Cousin Buddie, stupid imp&#x2014;applauded, very faintly, very provokingly. Some one else snickered.<br><br> "Emma Lou Morgan."<br><br> The principal had called her name again, more sharply than before and his smile was less benevolent. The girl who sat to the left of her nudged her. There was nothing else for her to do but to get out of that anchoring chair and march forward to receive her diploma. But why did the people in the audience have to stare so? Didn't they all know that Emma Lou Morgan was Boise high school's only nigger student? Didn't they all know&#x2014;but what was the use? She had to go get that diploma, so summoning her most insouciant manner, she advanced to the platform center, brought every muscle of her lithe limbs into play, haughtily extended her shiny black arm to receive the proffered diploma, bowed a chilly thanks, then holding her arms stiffly at her sides, insolently returned to her seat in that foreboding white line, insolently returned once more to splotch its pale purity and to mock it with her dark, outlandish difference.<br> Emma Lou had been born in a semi-white world, totally surrounded by an all-white one, and those few dark elements that had forced their way in had either been shooed away or else greeted with derisive laughter. It was the custom always of those with whom she came into most frequent contact to ridicule or revile any black person or object. A black cat was a harbinger of bad luck, black crepe was the insignia of mourning, and black people were either evil niggers with poisonous blue gums or else typical vaudeville darkies. It seemed as if the people in her world never went halfway in their recognition or reception of things black, for these things seemed always to call forth only the most extreme emotional reactions. They never provoked mere smiles or mere melancholy; rather they were the signal either for boisterous guffaws or pain-induced and tear-attended grief.<br><br> Emma Lou had been becoming increasingly aware of this for a long time, but her immature mind had never completely grasped its full, and to her tragic, significance. First there had been the case of her father, old black Jim Morgan they called him, and Emma Lou had often wondered why it was that he of all the people she heard discussed by her family should always be referred to as if his very blackness condemned him to receive no respect from his fellow men.<br><br> She had also begun to wonder if it was because of his blackness that he had never been in evidence as far as she knew. Inquiries netted very unsatisfactory answers. "Your father is no good." "He left your mother, deserted her shortly after you were born." And these statements were always prefixed or followed by some epithet such as "dirty black no-gooder" or "durn his onery black hide." There was in fact only one member of the family who did not speak of her father in this manner, and that was her Uncle Joe, who was also the only person in the family to whom she really felt akin, because he alone never seemed to regret, to bemoan, or to ridicule her blackness of skin. It was her grandmother who did all the regretting, her mother who did the bemoaning, her Cousin Buddie and her playmates, both white and colored, who did the ridiculing.<br><br> Emma Lou's maternal grandparents, Samuel and Maria Lightfoot, were both mulatto products of slave-day promiscuity between male masters and female chattel. Neither had been slaves, their own parents having been granted their freedom because of their close connections with the white branch of the family tree. These freedmen had migrated into Kansas with their children, and when these children had grown up they in turn had joined the westward-ho parade of that current era, and finally settled in Boise, Idaho.<br><br> Samuel and Maria, like many others of their kind and antecedents, had had only one compelling desire, which motivated their every activity and dictated their every thought. They wished to put as much physical and mental space between them and the former home of their parents as was possible. That was why they had left Kansas, for in Kansas there were too many reminders of that which their parents had escaped and from which they wished to flee. Kansas was too near the former slave belt, too accessible to disgruntled southerners, who, deprived of their slaves, were inculcated with an easily communicable virus, nigger hatred. Then, too, in Kansas all Negroes were considered as belonging to one class. It didn't matter if you and your parents had been freedmen before the Emancipation Proclamation, nor did it matter that you were almost three-quarters white. You were, nevertheless, classed with those hordes of hungry, ragged, ignorant black folk arriving from the South in such great numbers, packed like so many stampeding cattle in dirty, manure-littered box cars.<br><br> From all of this these maternal grandparents of Emma Lou fled, fled to the Rocky Mountain states which were too far away for the recently freed slaves to reach, especially since most of them believed that the world ended just a few miles north of the Mason-Dixon line. Then, too, not only were the Rocky Mountain states beyond the reach of this raucous and smelly rabble of recently freed cotton pickers and plantation hands, but they were also peopled by pioneers, sturdy land and gold seekers from the East, marching westward, always westward in search of El Dorado, and being too busy in this respect to be violently aroused by problems of race unless economic factors precipitated matters.<br><br> So Samuel and Maria went into the fast farness of a little known Rocky Mountain territory and settled in Boise, at the time nothing more than a trading station for the Indians and whites, and a red light center for the cowboys and sheepherders and miners in the neighboring vicinity. Samuel went into the saloon business and grew prosperous. Maria raised a family and began to mother nuclear elements for a future select Negro social group.<br><br> There was of course in such a small and haphazardly populated community some social intermixture between whites and blacks. White and black gamblers rolled the dice together, played tricks on one another while dealing faro, and became allies in their attempts to outfigure the roulette wheel. White and black men amicably frequented the saloons and dancehalls together. White and black women leaned out of the doorways and windows of the jerry-built frame houses and log cabins of "Whore Row." White and black housewives gossiped over back fences and lent one another needed household commodities. But there was little social intercourse on a higher scale. Sluefoot Sal, the most popular high yaller on "Whore Row," might be a buddy to Irish Peg and Blond Liz, but Mrs. Amos James, whose husband owned the town's only dry-goods store, could certainly not become too familiar with Mrs. Samuel Lightfoot, colored, whose husband owned a saloon. And it was not a matter of the difference in their respective husbands' businesses. Mrs. Amos James did associate with Mrs. Arthur Emory, white, whose husband also owned a saloon. It was purely a matter of color.<br><br> Emma Lou's grandmother then, holding herself aloof from the inmates of "Whore Row," and not wishing to associate with such as old Mammy Lewis' daughters, who did most of the town wash, and others of their ilk, was forced to choose her social equals slowly and carefully. This was hard, for there were so few Negroes in Boise anyway that there wasn't much cream to skim off. But as the years passed, others who, like Maria and her husband, were mulatto offsprings of mulatto freedmen seeking a freer land, moved in, and were soon initiated into what was later to be known as the blue vein circle, so named because all of its members were fair-skinned enough for their blood to be seen pulsing purple through the veins of their wrists.<br><br> Emma Lou's grandmother was the founder and the acknowledged leader of Boise's blue veins, and she guarded its exclusiveness passionately and jealously. Were they not a superior class? Were they not a very high type of Negro, comparable to the persons of color groups in the West Indies? And were they not entitled, ipso facto, to more respect and opportunity and social acceptance than the more pure blooded Negroes? In their veins was some of the best blood of the South. They were closely akin to the only true aristocrats in the United States. Even the slave masters had been aware of and acknowledged in some measure their superiority. Having some of Marse George's blood in their veins set them apart from ordinary Negroes at birth. These mulattoes as a rule were not ordered to work in the fields beneath the broiling sun at the urge of a Simon Legree lash. They were saved and trained for the more gentle jobs, saved and trained to be ladies' maids and butlers. Therefore, let them continue this natural division of Negro society. Let them also guard against unwelcome and degenerating encroachments. Their motto must be "Whiter and whiter every generation," until the grandchildren of the blue veins could easily go over into the white race and become assimilated so that problems of race would plague them no more.<br><br> Maria had preached this doctrine to her two children, Jane and Joe, throughout their apprentice years, and can therefore be forgiven for having a physical collapse when they both, first Joe, then Emma Lou's mother, married not mulattoes, but a copper brown and a blue black. This had been somewhat of a necessity, for, when the mating call had made itself heard to them, there had been no eligible blue veins around. Most of their youthful companions had been sent away to school or else to seek careers in eastern cities, and those few who had remained had already found their chosen life's companions. Maria had sensed that something of the kind might happen and had urged Samuel to send Jane and Joe away to some eastern boarding school, but Samuel had very stubbornly refused. He had his own notions of the sort of things one's children learned in boarding school, and of the greater opportunities they had to apply that learning. True, they might acquire the same knowledge in the public schools of Boise, but then there would be some limit to the extent to which they could apply this knowledge, seeing that they lived at home and perforce must submit to some parental supervision. A cot in the attic at home was to Samuel a much safer place for a growing child to sleep than an iron four poster in a boarding school dormitory.<br><br>So Samuel had remained adamant and the two carefully reared scions of Boise&#x2019;s first blue vein family had of necessity&nbsp;sought their mates among the lower orders. However, Joe&#x2019;s wife was not as undesirable as Emma Lou&#x2019;s father, for she was almost three-quarters Indian, and there was scant possibility that her children would have revolting dark skins, thick lips, spreading nostrils, and kinky hair. But in the case of Emma Lou&#x2019;s father, there were no such extenuating characteristics, for his physical properties undeniably stamped him as a full blooded Negro. In fact, it seemed as if he had come from one of the few families originally from Africa, who could not boast of having been seduced by some member of southern aristocracy, or befriended by some member of a strolling band of Indians.<br><br>No one&nbsp;could understa...</p><h2>German Philosophers: Kant, Hegel, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche (Past Masters)</h2><p><em>German Philosophers</em> contains studies of four of the most important German theorists: Kant, arguably the most influential modern philosopher; Hegel, whose philosophy inspired a vision of a communist society that for more than one hundred years enlivened revolutionary movements around the world; Schopenhauer, renowned for his pessimistic view that for human individual non-existence would be preferable; and Nietzsche, who has been appropriated as an icon by an astonishingly diverse spectrum of people.<br> Written by leading scholars in the field, <em>German Philosophers</em> is the only work to bring together texts on the four philosophers who represent a central school of German philosophy.

DARK MOON is the answer to the question-did the Apollo missions really land a man on the Moon and return him alive and well to Earth, or is the record incorrect?</p><p>Mary Bennet and David Percy are professional researchers who have spent more than five years working on this book as well as a television documentary.

Does obtaining a college degree increase an individual&#39;s labor market earnings? Did the use of a butterfly ballot in some Florida counties in the 2000 presidential election cost Al Gore votes? Simple cause-and-effect questions such as these are the motivation for much empirical work in the social sciences. In this book, the counterfactual model of causality for observational data analysis is presented, and methods for causal effect estimation are demonstrated using examples from sociology, political science, and economics.</p><p>Stephen L.

The units on Africa, West and Central Asia, South, East, and Southeast Asia, the Pacific, and Global Contemporary pose a particular problem. Existing textbooks and review books provide limited coverage that includes either short paragraphs or a list of bullet points. In addition, many AP Art History courses must rush to cover these works of art. Beyond the European Tradition with Global Contemporary is designed to provide concise, clear, and interesting narratives for each of the 84 works in Content Areas 6 &#x2013; 10. Each narrative begins with a quarter page picture of the required image. The essay then describes the work&#x2019;s form, function, context, and content. In addition, each narrative concludes with a Making Connection feature linking the work to other required works. For example, the Making Connections feature for Travelers among Mountains and Streams compares Fan Kuan&#x2019;s use of shifting perspective with Bruegel&#x2019;s use of linear perspective in Hunters in the Snow. The volume concludes with 80 realistic multiple-choice practice questions testing key points about the works covered in this volume. A distinctive glossary provides concise definitions along with relevant examples from the required list of 250 works.</p><p>Larry Krieger earned his B.A. and M.A.T. from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and his M.A. from Wake Forest University.

With the pace and suspense of a thriller and prose that has been compared to Graham Greene and Saul Bellow, <i>The Sympathizer</i> is a sweeping epic of love and betrayal. The narrator, a communist double agent, is a man of two minds,&#x201d; a half-French, half-Vietnamese army captain who arranges to come to America after the Fall of Saigon, and while building a new life with other Vietnamese refugees in Los Angeles is secretly reporting back to his communist superiors in Vietnam. <i>The Sympathizer</i> is a blistering exploration of identity and America, a gripping espionage novel, and a powerful story of love and friendship.<br></p><p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of April 2015:</strong> Viet Thanh Nguyen&#x2019;s <em>The Sympathizer</em> brilliantly draws you in with the opening line: &#x201c;I am a spy, a sleeper, a spook, a man of two faces.&#x201d; It&#x2019;s thrilling, rhythmic, and astonishing, as is the rest of Nguyen&#x2019;s enthralling portrayal of the Vietnam War. The narrator is an undercover communist agent posing as a captain in the Southern Vietnamese Army. Set during the fall of Saigon and the years after in America, the captain spies on the general and the men he escaped with, sharing his information with his communist blood brothers in coded letters. But when his allegiance is called into question, he must act in a way that will haunt him forever.

Chapters cover all facets of building construction from foundations to furnishings and are structured to follow the drawing preparation sequence of a typical rehabilitation project. Architects, designers, and others involved in rebuilding and renovating structures built in decades past will find here many of the details and information used by the original architects and builders. Impeccably organized and beautifully rendered, this handsome reference is both a terrific working tool and a wonderful addition to an architecture library.</p><p>This handsome text contains the best and most representative traditional-style details from volumes 1 through 4 of Architectural Graphic Standards. The focus is on materials and details once again in high demand owing to the increase in building rehabilitation, historic preservation, and the rise of post-modern achitecture. Topics include roofing made of slate, clay tile, and copper and other metals; classical cabinetwork; and walls and paving of stone. Also included are old stock sizes of steel and lumber. Arranged in a format that parallels the drawing preparation sequence of a rehabilitation project, the text employs the same hand-drawn style of early editions of Architectural Graphic Standards and includes a useful bibliography of books on building rehabilitation and historic preservation. More than a collector&#39;s item, Traditional Details from Architectural Graphic Standards is a hands-on, practical guide.</p><h2>Imagination and the Arts in C. S. Lewis: Journeying to Narnia and Other Worlds</h2><p>Imagination has long been regarded as central to C. S. Lewis&#x2019;s life and to his creative and critical works, but this is the first study to provide a thorough analysis of his theory of imagination, including the different ways he used the word and how those uses relate to each other. Peter Schakel begins by concentrating on the way reading or engaging with the other arts is an imaginative activity. He focuses on three books in which imagination is the central theme&#x2014;<i>Surprised by Joy, An Experiment in Criticism</i>, and <i>The Discarded Image</i>&#x2014;and shows the important role of imagination in Lewis&#x2019;s theory of education.He then examines imagination and reading in Lewis&#x2019;s fiction, concentrating specifically on the Chronicles of Narnia, the most imaginative of his works. He looks at how the imaginative experience of reading the Chronicles is affected by the physical texture of the books, the illustrations, revisions of the texts, the order in which the books are read, and their narrative &#x201c;voice,&#x201d; the &#x201c;storyteller&#x201d; who becomes almost a character in the stories.<i>Imagination and the Arts in C. S. Lewis</i> also explores Lewis&#x2019;s ideas about imagination in the nonliterary arts. Although Lewis regarded engagement with the arts as essential to a well-rounded and satisfying life, critics of his work and even biographers have given little attention to this aspect of his life. Schakel reviews the place of music, dance, art, and architecture in Lewis&#x2019;s life, the ways in which he uses them as content in his poems and stories, and how he develops some of the deepest, most significant themes of his stories through them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Schakel concludes by analyzing the uses and abuses of imagination. He looks first at&nbsp;&#x201c;moral imagination.&#x201d;&nbsp;Although Lewis did not use this term, Schakel shows how Lewis developed the concept in <i>That Hideous Strength</i> and <i>The Abolition of Man</i> long before it became popularized in the 1980s and 1990s. While readers often concentrate on the Christian dimension of Lewis&#x2019;s works, equally or more important to him was their moral dimension.&nbsp;<i>Imagination and the Arts in C. S. Lewis </i>will appeal to students and teachers of both children&#x2019;s literature and twentieth-century British writers. It will also be of value to readers who wish to compare Lewis&#x2019;s creations with more recent imaginative works such as the Harry Potter series.</p><p><p>First study to provide a thorough analysis of C.

Along with a clever plot, well-drawn characters make us want to continue reading a novel or finish watching a movie. In <i>Creating Characters</i>, Dwight V. Swain shows how writers can invent interesting characters and improve them so that they move a story along.<p>'The core of character,' he says in chapter 1, 'lies in each individual story person s ability to care about something; to feel implicitly or explicitly, that something is important.' Building on that foundation the capacity to care Swain takes the would-be writer step-by-step through the fundamentals of finding and developing 'characters who turn you on.' This basic but thought-provoking how-to is a valuable tool for both the novice and the seasoned writer.</p></p><p><b>Dwight V. Swain</b> spent a lifetime writing newspaper and magazine articles, pulp fiction, and screenplays. For more than twenty years he taught in the Professional Writing Program at the University of Oklahoma.

Students can browse through the 17 chapters, each titled and annotated, without reading the book from cover to cover.

But it is Smith&#39;s mother, hardworking, no-nonsense Mary, who leads him by the hand to his Irish heritage and pulls him by the ear into adulthood.

Set in Louis XIII&#39;s reign, it is the moving and exciting drama of one of the finest swordsmen in France, gallant soldier, brilliant wit, tragic poet-lover with the face of a clown. Rostand&#39;s extraordinary lyric powers gave birth to a universal hero--Cyrano De Bergerac--and ensured his own reputation as author of one of the best-loved plays in the literature of the stage. This translation, by the American poet Brian Hooker, is nearly as famous as the original play itself, and is generally considered to be one of the finest English verse translations ever written.<p>Edmond Rostand (1868&#x2013;1918) was a French playwright whose other works include <i>The Princess Faraway</i>, <i>The Woman of Samaria</i>, and <i>L&#x2019;Aiglon</i>.</p></p><h2>Reading Between the Signs Workbook: A Cultural Guide for Sign Language Interpreters</h2><p>This helpful workbook functions as a companion and supplement to Anna Mindess&#39;s earlier book, Reading Between the Signs: A Cultural Guide for Sign Language Interpreters, a recognized classic text for sign language interpreters and ASL students. It is arranged to correspond with the theory presented in the book and expands its focus to the relativity of politeness and the distinction between direct and indirect communication styles, both of which are important elements in comparing Deaf and mainstream cultures.Hands-on exercises allow students to better comprehend the sometimes-puzzling differences of culturally appropriate behavior. The book also helps students explore their own culture as well as the American Deaf culture in ways that reveal the differences between the two. Role play, discussion topics, and critical incidents increase first-hand understanding of the relationship between the Deaf and Hearing communities. The workbook is skillfully designed to provide various thought-provoking exercises that reinforce the topics presented in the textbook. In addition, the work-book exercises allow the reader to discover personally the power of culture in shaping our lives. Mindess has made an admirable effort to assemble and update many of the tried-and-true cultural awareness exercises from the pioneers of Intercultural Communication (ICC). She has also contributed many original activities that I have successfully used in my own ICC classes. Mindess has created a highly effective instructional tool to discover the significance of culture. As the reader completes each exercise, a small bit of enlightenment emerges. When all the bits are arranged in a mosaic, they create a self-portrait of cultural awareness. -Linda A. Siple, National Technical Institute for the Deaf This workbook is a wonderful accompaniment to an exceptionally valuable tool for teaching Deaf culture, ASL, and sign language interpreting. One might also hope for an advanced workbook in the future, as some of the subtler and more complex issues dealt so well in the original text are beyond the scope of the current workbook...the book&#39;s excellent chapter entitled &#39;Cultural Sensitivity Shouldn&#39;t End at Five O&#39;Clock&#39; should be required reading for anyone considering working with Deaf people.

In keeping with his lifelong mission as a "minority man," John Taylor wrote <b><i>Tyranny Unmasked</i></b> not only to assault the protective tariff and the mercantilist policies of the times but also "to examine general principles in relation to commerce, political economy, and a free government." Originally published in 1822, it is the only major work of Taylor's that has never before been reprinted.</p><p>As an early discussion of the principles of governmental power and their relationship to political economy and liberty, <b><i>Tyranny Unmasked</i></b> is an important primary source in the study of American history and political thought.</p><p><b>F. Thornton Miller</b> is Professor of History at Southwest Missouri State University.</p></p><p>The scion of one of colonial Virginia&#39;s most respected families, JOHN TAYLOR (1753-1824) served as an officer in the Continental army and the Virginia militia during the American Revolution. A successful lawyer and gentleman farmer, he was an advocate of scientific farming, and was the first president of the Virginia Agricultural Society. He served in the Virginia state legislature in the 1780s and 1790s and as U.S. Senator for the state through much of the early 19th century.A staunch defender of the rights of individuals and a stout watchdog against rising federal power during the early decades of nationhood of the United States, John Taylor explains, in plain but passionate language, the dangers of the governmental interference in the free exercise of commerce. <p> Though written as a vehement response to a particular event--the proposal of a tariff to help expand industry--1821's Tyranny Unmasked remains a cogent argument today, in an era of powerful special interests lobbying for, and often receiving, preferential treatment from the U.S. federal government. Powerfully relevant, it is essential reading for anyone interested in the economic and cultural health of the nation.</p></p><h2>Deadeye Dick</h2><p>A young boy&#39;s life is irrevocably changed when he accidently kills a pregnant woman while playing with one of his father&#39;s many rifles</p><p>Kurt Vonnegut is a unique voice in the American canon &#x2014; a writer whose works are hard to categorize, often straddling the space between literature and science fiction, and filled with cutting satire and dark humor. Like Mark Twain before him, Vonnegut's reputation and impact on American writing and reading will continue to grow steadily and increase in relevance as new insights are made. Vonnegut was born in 1922 in Indianapolis, and studied at the University of Chicago and the University of Tennessee. In the Second World War, he became a German prisoner of war and was present during the bombing of Dresden. This experience provided inspiration for his most successful and influential novel, Slaughterhouse-Five. Vonnegut &#x2014; admired as much for his views and his &#x201c;Vonnegutisms&#x201d; as for his publications &#x2014; wrote extensively in many forms, including novels, short stories, essays, plays, articles, speeches, and correspondence, some of which was published posthumously.To the as-yet-unborn, to all innocent wisps of undifferentiated nothingness: Watch out for life.<br><br>I have caught life. I have come down with life. I was a wisp of undifferentiated nothingness, and then a little peephole opened quite suddenly. Light and sound poured in. Voices began to describe me and my surroundings. Nothing they said could be appealed. They said I was a boy named Rudolph Waltz, and that was that. They said the year was 1932, and that was that. They said I was in Midland City, Ohio, and that was that.<br><br>They never shut up. Year after year they piled detail upon detail. They do it still. You know what they say now? They say the year is 1982, and that I am fifty years old.<br><br>Blah blah blah.<br><br>My father was Otto Waltz, whose peephole opened in 1892, and he was told, among other things, that he was the heir to a fortune earned principally by a quack medicine known as "Saint Elmo's Remedy." It was grain alcohol dyed purple, flavored with cloves and sarsaparilla root, and laced with opium and cocaine. As the joke goes: It was absolutely harmless unless discontinued.<br><br>He, too, was a Midland City native. He was an only child, and his mother, on the basis of almost no evidence whatsoever, concluded that he could be another Leonardo da Vinci. She had a studio built for him on a loft of the carriage house behind the family mansion when he was only ten years old, and she hired a rapscallion German cabinetmaker, who had studied art in Berlin in his youth, to give Father drawing and painting lessons on weekends and after school.<br><br>It was a sweet racket for both teacher and pupil. The teacher's name was August Gunther, and his peephole must have opened in Germany around 1850. Teaching paid as well as cabinetmaking, and, unlike cabinetmaking, allowed him to be as drunk as he pleased.<br><br>After Father's voice changed, moreover, Gunther could take him on overnight visits by rail to Indianapolis and Cincinnati and Louisville and Cleveland and so on, ostensibly to visit galleries and painters' studios. The two of them also managed to get drunk, and to become darlings of the fanciest whorehouses in the Middle West.<br><br>Was either one of them about to acknowledge that Father couldn't paint or draw for sour apples?<br><br>Who else was there to detect the fraud? Nobody. There wasn't anybody else in Midland City who cared enough about art to notice if Father was gifted or not. He might as well have been a scholar of Sanskrit, as far as the rest of the town was concerned.<br><br>Midland City wasn't a Vienna or a Paris. It wasn't even a St. Louis or a Detroit. It was a Bucyrus. It was a Kokomo.<br><br>Gunther's treachery was discovered, but too late. He and Father were arrested in Chicago after doing considerable property damage in a whorehouse there, and Father was found to have gonorrhea, and so on. But Father was by then a fully committed, eighteen-year-old good-time Charley.<br><br>Gunther was denounced and fired and blacklisted. Grandfather and Grandmother Waltz were tremendously influential citizens, thanks to Saint Elmo's Remedy. They spread the word that nobody of quality in Midland City was ever to hire Gunther for cabinetwork or any other sort of work--ever again.<br><br>Father was sent to relatives in Vienna, to have his gonorrhea treated and to enroll in the world-famous Academy of Fine Arts. While he was on the high seas, in a first-class cabin aboard the <i>Lusitania</i>, his parents' mansion burned down. It was widely suspected that the showplace was torched by August Gunther, but no proof was found.<br><br>Father's parents, rather than rebuilt, took up residence in their thousand-acre farm out near Shepherdstown--leaving behind the carriage house and a cellar hole.<br><br>This was in 1910--four years before the outbreak of the First World War.<br><br>So Father presented himself at the Academy of Fine Arts with a portfolio of pictures he had created in Midland City. I myself have examined some of the artwork of his youth, which Mother used to moon over after he died. He was good at cross-hatching and shading a drapery, and August Gunther must have been capable in those areas, too. But with few exceptions, everything Father depicted wound up looking as though it were made of cement--a cement woman in a cement dress, walking a cement dog, a herd of cement cattle, a cement bowl of cement fruit, set before a window with cement curtains, and so on.<br><br>He was no good at catching likenesses, either. He showed the Academy several portraits of his mother, and I have no idea what she looked like. Her peephole closed long before mine opened. But I do know that no two of Father's portraits of her resemble each other in the least.<br><br>Father was told to come back to the Academy in two weeks, at which time they would tell him whether they would take him in or not.<br><br>He was in rags at the time, with a piece of rope for a belt, and with patched trousers and so on--although he was receiving an enormous allowance from home. Vienna was then the capital of a great empire, and there were so many elaborate uniforms and exotic costumes, and so much wine and music that it seemed to Father to be a fancy dress ball. So he decided to come to the party as a starving artist. What fun!<br><br>And he must have been very good-looking then, for he was, in my opinion, the best-looking man in Midland City when I got to know him a quarter of a century later. He was slender and erect to the end. He was six feet tall. His eyes were blue. He had curly golden hair, and he had lost almost none of it when his peephole closed, when he was allowed to stop being Otto Waltz, when he became just another wisp of undifferentiated nothingness again.<br><br>So he came back in two weeks, and a professor handed him back his portfolio, saying that his work was ludicrous. And there was another young man in rags there, and he, too, had his portfolio returned with scorn.<br><br>His name was Adolf Hitler. He was a native Austrian. He had come from Linz.<br><br>And Father was so mad at the professor that he got his revenge right then and there. He asked to see some of Hitler's work, with the professor looking on. He picked a picture at random, and he said it was a brilliant piece of work, and he bought it from Hitler for more cash on the spot than the professor, probably, could earn in a month or more.<br><br>Only an hour before, Hitler had sold his overcoat so that he could get a little something to eat, even though winter was coming on. So there is a chance that, if it weren't for my father, Hitler might have died of pneumonia or malnutrition in 1910.<br><br>Father and Hitler paired off for a while, as people will--comforting and amusing each other, jeering at the art establishment which had rejected them, and so on. I know they took several long walking trips, just the two of them. I learned of their good times together from Mother. When I was old enough to be curious about Father's past, World War Two was about to break out, and Father had developed lockjaw as far as his friendship with Hitler was concerned.<br><br>Think of that: My father could have strangled the worst monster of the century, or simply let him starve or freeze to death. But he became his bosom buddy instead.<br><br>That is my principal objection to life, I think: It is too easy, when alive, to make perfectly horrible mistakes.<br><br>The painting Father bought from Hitler was a watercolor which is now generally acknowledged as having been the best thing the monster ever did as a painter, and it hung for many years over my parents' bed in Midland City, Ohio. Its title was: "The Minorite Church of Vienna."<br><i><br>Chapter Two</i><br>Father was so well received in Vienna, known to one and all as an American millionaire disguised as a ragged genius, that he roistered there for nearly four years. When the First World War broke out in August of 1914, he imagined that the fancy dress ball was to become a fancy dress picnic, that the party was to be moved out into the countryside. He was so happy, so naive, so self-enchanted, that he asked influential friends if they couldn't get him a commission in the Hungarian Life Guard, whose officers' uniforms included a panther skin.<br><br>He adored that panther skin.<br><br>He was summoned by the American ambassador to the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Henry Clowes, who was a Cleveland man and an acquaintance of Father's parents. Father was then twenty-two years old. Clowes told Father that he would lose his American citizenship if he joined a foreign army, and that he had made inquiries about Father, and had learned that Father was not the painter he pretended to be, and that Father had been spending money like a drunken sailor, and that he had written to Father's parents, telling them that their son had lost all touch with reality, and that it was time Father was summoned home and given some honest work to do.<br><br>"What if I refuse?" said Father.<br><br>"Your parents have agreed to stop your allowance," said Clowes.<br><br>So Father went home.<br><br>I do not believe he would have stayed in Midland City, if it weren't for what remained of his childhood home, which was its fanciful carriage house. It was hexagonal. It was stone. It had a conical slate roof. It had a naked skeleton inside of noble oak beams. It was a little piece of Europe in southwestern Ohio. It was a present from my great-grandfather Waltz to his homesick wife from Hamburg. It was a stone-by-stone replica of a structure in an illustration in her favorite book of German fairy tales.<br><br>It still stands.<br><br>I once showed it to an art historian from Ohio University, which is in Athens, Ohio. He said that the original might have been a medieval granary built on the ruins of a Roman watchtower from the time of Julius Caesar. Caesar was murdered two thousand years ago.<br><br>Think of that.<br><br>I do not think my father was entirely ungifted as an artist. Like his friend Hitler, he had a flair for romantic architecture. And he set about transforming the carriage house into a painter's studio fit for the reincarnated Leonardo da Vinci his doting mother still believed him to be.<br><br>Father's mother was as crazy as a bedbug, my own mother said.<br><br>I sometimes think that I would have had a very different sort of soul, if I had grown up in an ordinary little American house--if our home had not been vast.<br><br>Father got rid of all the horse-drawn vehicles in the carriage house--a sleigh, a buckboard, a surrey, a phaeton, a brougham, and who-knows-what-all? Then he had ten horse stalls and a tack room ripped out. This gave him for his private enjoyment more uninterrupted floor-space beneath a far higher ceiling than was afforded by any house of worship or public building in the Midland City of that time.<br><br>Was it big enough for a basketball game? A basketball court is ninety-four feet long and fifty feet wide. My childhood home was only eighty feet in diameter. So, no--it lacked fourteen feet of being big enough for a basketball game.<br><br>There were two pairs of enormous doors in the carriage house, wide enough to admit a carriage and a team of horses. One pair faced north, one pair faced south. Father had his workmen take down the northern pair, which has old mentor, August Gunther, made into two tables, a dining table and a table on which Father's paints and brushes and palette knives and charcoal sticks and so on were to be displayed.<br><br>The doorway was then filled with what remains the largest window in the city, admitting copious quantities of that balm for all great painters, northern light.<br><br>It was before this window that Father's easel stood.<br><br>Yes, he had been reunited with the disreputable August Gunther, who must have been in his middle sixties then. Old Gunther had only one child, a daughter named Grace, so Father was like a son to him. A more suitable son for Gunther would be hard to imagine.<br><br>Mother was just a little girl then, and living in a mansion next door. She was terrified of old Gunther. She told me one time that all nice little girls were supposed to run away from him. Right up until the time Mother died, she cringed if August Gunther was mentioned. He was a hobgoblin to her. He was the bogeyman.<br><br>As for the pair of great doors facing south: Father had them bolted shut and padlocked, and the workmen caulked the cracks between and around them, to keep out the wind. And then August Gunther cut a front door into one of them. That was the entrance to Father's studio, what would later be my childhood home.<br><br>A hexagonal loft encircled and overhung the great chamber. This was partitioned off into bedrooms and bathrooms and a small library.<br><br>Above that was an attic under the conical slate roof. Father had no immediate use for the attic, so it was left in its primitive condition.<br><br>It was all so impractical--which I guess was the whole idea.<br><br>Father was so elated by the vastness of the ground floor, which was paved with cobblestones laid in sand, that he considered putting the kitchen up on a loft. But that would have put the servants and all their hustle and bustle and cooking smells up among the bedrooms. There was no basement to put them in.<br><br>So he reluctantly put the kitchen on the ground floor, tucked under a loft and partitioned off with old boards. It was cramped and stuffy. I would love it. I would feel so safe and cozy in there.<br><br>Many people found our house spooky, and the attic in fact was full of evil when I was born. It housed a collection of more than three hundred antique and modern firearms. Father had bought them during his and Mother's six-month honeymoon in Europe in 1922. Father thought them beautiful, but they might as well have been copperheads and rattlesnakes.<br><br>They were murder.</p><h2>Cultivating Outdoor Classrooms: Designing and Implementing Child-Centered Learning Environments</h2><p><p>Create an outdoor learning program<br><br>Transform outdoor spaces into learning environments where children can enjoy a full range of activities as they spend quality time in nature.

Children are more likely to invent their own games in green play spaces than they are on flat cement or playing fields. The outdoor classroom can also promote social inclusion, regardless of gender, race, class, or intellectual ability. More research is on the way.

Children are more likely to invent their own games in green play spaces than they are on flat cement or playing fields. The outdoor classroom can also promote social inclusion, regardless of gender, race, class, or intellectual ability. More research is on the way. Yet, in many legislators&#x2019; and even some parents&#x2019; eyes, the educational benefits of nature experience barely registers. Eric Nelson is working to change that. Along with other farsighted pioneers, Nelson is a proponent of the outdoor classroom, as well as an early leader promoting on-site company child care. With <i>Cultivating Outdoor Classrooms</i>, he shows in simple, clear, and compelling language how to create an outdoor classroom and why. He offers moral context and emphasizes education not just for education&#x2019;s sake, but for the mental and physical health, learning ability, creativity, awe, and wonder of the whole child.

Alone they were a shortstop, a second baseman, and a first baseman. But together they were an unstoppable force. Joe Tinker, Johnny Evers, and Frank Chance came together in rough-and-tumble early twentieth-century Chicago and soon formed the defensive core of the most formidable team in big league baseball, leading the Chicago Cubs to four National League pennants and two World Series championships from 1906 to 1910. At the same time, baseball was transforming from small-time diversion into a nationwide sensation. Americans from all walks of life became infected with &#x201c;baseball fever,&#x201d; a phenomenon of unprecedented enthusiasm and social impact. The national pastime was coming of age.<br><br><i>Tinker to Evers to Chance</i> examines this pivotal moment in American history, when baseball became the game we know today. Each man came from a different corner of the country and brought a distinctive local culture with him: Evers from the Irish-American hothouse of Troy, New York; Tinker from the urban parklands of Kansas City, Missouri; Chance from the verdant fields of California&#x2019;s Central Valley. The stories of these early baseball stars shed unexpected light not only on the evolution of baseball and on the enthusiasm of its players and fans all across America, but also on the broader convulsions transforming the US into a confident new industrial society. With them emerged a truly national culture.<br><br> This iconic trio helped baseball reinvent itself, but their legend has largely been relegated to myths and barroom trivia. David Rapp&#x2019;s engaging history resets the story and brings these men to life again, enabling us to marvel anew at their feats on the diamond. It&#x2019;s a rare look at one of baseball&#x2019;s first dynasties in action.</p><p><b>David Rapp </b>has been a political journalist and publishing executive in Washington, DC, for more than thirty years. He is the former editor of<i> Congressional Quarterly</i>, as well as the author of <i>How the U.S. Got into Agriculture&#x2014;and Why It Can&#x2019;t Get Out</i>.&#x201c;The compelling narrative not only details the feats these three achieved in helping establish a Cubs dynasty, but also chronicles the metamorphosis of the new twentieth-century nation that embraced baseball as a game that reflected the urban strength developed in modern industry while also offering green-field comfort to city-dwellers nostalgic for a rural past. A potent reminder of how America first fell in love with its national pastime.&#x201d; (Starred Review <i>Booklist</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Vividly details the lives of all three players, weaving together how they converged in Chicago at the beginning of the 20th century.

As no Chicago baseball fan needs reminding, they&#x2019;d famously go more than a century, until 2016, without winning another. . . . They did all of it at a time when baseball, like the city of Chicago and the rest of the big country around it, was daring to reimagine itself in a way that would make America embrace it as the national pastime.&#x201d; (<i>Washington Independent Review of Books</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Rapp . . . show(s) the role baseball, a relatively new sport back then, played in changing the lives of the three men who came from markedly different backgrounds. He also details how the game, thanks in part to the success of the Cubs, gained a massive foothold in Chicago and elsewhere throughout the country.&#x201d; (<i>Northwest Indiana Times</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Exceptionally well researched, written, organized and presented, <i>Tinker to Evers to Chance</i> is a &#x2018;must&#x2019; for the legions of Chicago Cubs fans.

In&nbsp;<i>The Richer Sex</i>, Liza Mundy takes us to the exciting frontier of this new economic order: she shows us why this flip is inevitable, what painful adjustments will have to be made along the way, and how both men and women will feel surprisingly liberated in the end.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bestselling author and&nbsp;<i>Washington Post</i>&nbsp;writer goes deep inside the lives of the couples on this cutting edge to paint of picture of how dating, marriage, and home life are changing. How does this new generation of breadwomen navigate paying for a night on the town? In whose interest is it to delay commitment? Are men for the first time thinking of marriage the way women used to&#x2014;as a bet on the economic potential of a spouse? In this new world of men marrying up,&nbsp; are women learning to value new realms of male endeavor&#x2014;like parenting, protection, and a margarita at the ready?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The future is here, with couples today debating who must assume the responsibility of primary earner and who gets the freedom of being the slow track partner. With more men choosing to stay home, Mundy shows how that lifestyle has achieved a higher status and all the ways males have found to recover their masculinity. And the revolution is global: Mundy takes us from Japan to Denmark to show how both sexes are adapting as the marriage market has turned into a giant free-for-all, with men and women at different stages of this transformation finding partners in other countries who match their expectations.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>The Richer Sex</i>&nbsp;is a wild ride into the future, grounded in Mundy&#x2019;s peerless journalism, and bound to cause women and men of all generations to rethink what this social upheaval will mean.</p><p><b>Liza Mundy </b>is the bestselling author of <i>Michelle: A Biography</i> and<i> Everything Conceivable</i>.

Maybe somebody pointed it out at their annual Christmas gathering, or during one of the big reunions the Hawkins family holds every other summer. Or maybe there never was an aha moment. The knowledge just settled in until it became a fact they all knew, but hardly thought twice about. <i>We have become a family of female earners</i>.<br> <br>Which was not how the siblings had been raised.<br> <br>The siblings&#x2014;there are six of them&#x2014;grew up in the Detroit, Michigan, suburbs. Their mother, Marcelle Hawkins, had all six in less than six years, completing her childbearing by the time she was twenty-five and staying home to raise them. Their father, Gary, supported the family by working as an engineer for Ford. He didn&#x2019;t graduate from college, because in the 1960s and 1970s a man working for the U.S. auto industry didn&#x2019;t need to. During his career Gary Hawkins helped launch the Pinto, visited assembly plants and solved their problems, traveled to help open factories in other regions, and as his wife puts it, &#x201c;had his hand raised&#x201d; every time Ford needed an engineer to work overtime. His chief regret, in retirement, is how little he saw of the children as they grew.<br> <br>In contrast to his father, the oldest Hawkins sibling, Danny, graduated from the University of Michigan and married a woman whose earning potential was as high as or higher than his was. Danny took a job in financial services but was reluctant to work the crushing overtime load his bosses expected, so in the mid-1990s he left to become the happy, fulfilled hands-on parent to their two daughters, a stay-at-home father before the term got trendy. According to his own mother, Danny runs a household every bit as well as she did. He shops and cooks with such exactitude that he rarely ends up with leftovers, maintains a budgeting system that involves placing portions of money in a box with sections designated for specific uses, keeps a color-coded family appointment calendar, and has a stair step for each member on which he places packages and other belongings. On Halloween, for fun, he tried doing a statistical analysis of trick-or-treaters to gauge how much candy to buy the following year but decided there were too many unpredictable variables. Over the years, Danny has served as treasurer of the PTA, treasurer of the music boosters, treasurer of the co-op preschool, treasurer of their homeowners association, and sympathizing treasurer of the golf club they belong to. In the evenings he is happy to listen to the workday accounts of his wife, Susan, a senior vice president with the Henry Ford Health System, with her challenges and sharing in her triumphs.<br> <br>&#x201c;I have told Susie several times that my job is to make her life easier,&#x201d; says Danny. &#x201c;And I like doing it.&#x201d;<br> <br>Meanwhile, Danny&#x2019;s younger sister Leslie works in supply-chain management for a Michigan transportation and logistics company, where she has risen to be part of the top leadership team. Her own husband, Damon, who everybody thought would be a hotshot corporate lawyer and the main breadwinner in the family, instead stepped back to become the secondary earner, working as a real estate broker and becoming the on-call parent for their three children. Like his brother-in-law Danny, Damon cooks, ambitiously; golfs, formidably; drives children to lessons and sports games; cleans house; and is so comfortably domesticated that when some neighbors arrived for a card game and Damon answered the door holding a dust cloth, the neighborhood began calling him &#x201c;Coco.&#x201d; Damon, who is known for his humor, embraced the nickname and the reputation for housekeeping excellence that goes with it.<br> <br>Another grown-up Hawkins sibling, Rhonda, had no idea what she wanted to do with her life when she was a young adult. In college, Rhonda changed majors so many times she stopped counting. Eventually she switched to night classes and took a job as a receptionist at Magna International, a company that supplies systems and components to the auto industry. She began working in marketing, got her degree in that field, and did so well that she finds herself&#x2014;though she is too self-deprecating to allow that this is a big deal&#x2014;the company&#x2019;s head of global marketing. Her husband, Hank, works in the restaurant business and loves what he does, but scaled back his hours when Rhonda got a promotion that required her to take extensive overseas trips on short notice.<br> <br>Another Hawkins sibling, Lori, who works in finance, is in a committed relationship with another woman; both contribute monetarily to the household.<br> <br>The other Hawkins daughter, Shelly, is a divorced mother of two, supporting her own household with a job in the health-care field.<br> <br>Out of the six adult children of Gary and Marcelle Hawkins, only one&#x2014;Michael&#x2014;is in a traditional marriage where he has filled the role of primary earner.<br> <br>Six adult siblings. Five households supported by women. One generation. One complete economic flip.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s a profound change in the balance of economic power, a striking role reversal and one that was unplanned, barely noticed, in fact, sneaking up on the Hawkins family when nobody was looking. In a matter of decades, the traditional male breadwinner model has given way to one where women routinely support households and outearn the men they are married to, and nobody cares or thinks it&#x2019;s odd. The Hawkins family&#x2014;sane, functional, rooted in a midwestern state known for family values&#x2014;offers a convincing vision of what America is becoming. We are entering an era where women, not men, will become the top earners in households. We are entering the era in which roles will flip, as resoundingly as they have done in this family. You laugh, but that Big Flip is just around the corner.<br> <br>Not that long ago, in 1970, the percentage of U.S. wives who outearned their husbands was in the low single digits. Some of these women were super-achievers, but more often they were women married to men who were ailing, drifting, unsteady, or unemployable. For generations, female breadwinners were mostly poor women&#x2014;women whose husbands had difficulty providing. Forty years later, this template has changed dramatically, as the forces that produce female breadwinners have become more powerful and varied. Almost 40 percent of U.S. working wives now outearn their husbands, a percentage that has risen steeply in this country and many others, as more women have entered the workforce and remained committed to it. Women occupy 51 percent of managerial and professional jobs in the United States, and they dominate nine of the ten U.S. job categories expected to grow the most in the next decade.<br> <br>Part of this ascent is due to the gradual lifting of discriminatory practices that once funneled women into lower-paying sectors and obliged them to quit work when they got married. Part is due to long-term changes in the economy that have chipped away at male sectors like construction and manufacturing while bringing big increases in women&#x2019;s fields such as education and health care. And a large part is due to women&#x2019;s own grit and initiative, evidenced by the fact that women now outnumber men on college campuses in the United States as well as around the world. By the year 2050, demographers forecast, there will be 140 college-educated women in the United States for every 100 college-educated men. Globally, a generation of young women is entering the job market who are better educated than young men are, and poised to become the most financially powerful generation of women in history. In coming years, economists&#x2014;who study major transitions such as the rise of agrarian society, the dawn of the industrial age, the ascent of the white-collar office worker, the opening of the global economy&#x2014;will look back and see this as the era when women realized their earning power and, for the first time, outpaced their partners. &#x201c;The trends are clear,&#x201d; agrees Gary Becker, the Nobel Prize&#x2013;winning economist at the University of Chicago who pioneered the economic study of families, even predicting that &#x201c;we could see a day where women, on average, are earning more than men.&#x201d;<br> <br>In addition to the changes it will bring to the economy and the workplace, the rise of women earners will shape human behavior by challenging some of the most primal and hardwired ways men and women see one another. It will alter how we mate, how and when we join together, how we procreate and raise children, and, to use the phrase of the founders, how we pursue happiness. It will reshape the landscape of the heart. This is a book about how men and women are changing all those things already, and how these changes will play out in the future.<br> <br>Think the Hawkinses are an anomaly? A fluke? Consider Jessica Gasca, a resident of South Texas who works as a paralegal, supporting a husband and three children. Jessica likes being in the workforce. She prefers it to staying home. So her husband, Juan, watches the children and takes part-time jobs in customer service. &#x201c;Our kids see me as the father,&#x201d; says Jessica, who has several sisters who also are breadwinners in their households. These women, to their surprise, have emerged as dominant earners in their immigrant Hispanic community, a culture with strong patriarchal values yet one in which women are outstripping men even more rapidly than in the nation as a whole. For many, this creates profound discomfort. &#x201c;My mom always says: &#x2018;All my daughters&#x2014;I&#x2019;ve never taught you to be that way. I can&#x2019;t believe it.&#x2019; She says that we&#x2019;re providing for the man, when it should be the other way around.&#x201d;<br> <br>Or consider Alicia Simpson, a psychiatrist, and her sister, Tracy Parker, a banker. Both women are graduates of Howard University, an elite, historically black university in Washington, D.C., where nearly 70 percent of the student body is female. Alicia and Tracy, both in their forties, both mothers, grew up in a male-breadwinning family, and over dinner they tried to remember what they had expected starting out in their marriages, and to understand how it was that they ended up primary earners.<br> <br>&#x201c;I always figured it would be a partnership,&#x201d; said Alicia. &#x201c;Everybody sort of carrying his own weight.&#x201d; For these sisters, the change was so disconcerting that their marriages foundered. Alicia divorced her husband&#x2014;&#x201c;I had to push him out of the nest; it was like, either you&#x2019;re going to fly, or you&#x2019;re going to perish&#x201d;&#x2014;while Tracy worked through her resentment and struggled to accept her role. &#x201c;My husband&#x2019;s a great dad and I need him there,&#x201d; said Tracy. &#x201c;So it was a mind-set that I had to develop.&#x201d;<br> <br>Consider Rita Radzilowski and her sister, Ginette Trottier, both raised in a working-class family, both college graduates. Ginette, a nurse, married a business analyst who underwent a stretch of unemployment in the recent recession, when his company was sold and many positions were pushed overseas. Around the same time, Rita, who has an associate&#x2019;s degree, a bachelor&#x2019;s degree, and a master&#x2019;s degree&#x2014;among other credentials&#x2014;dated a professional brickmason who also lost his job. Neither man graduated from a four-year college. Both face a changing economy where high-paying jobs for non-grads are on the decline. The sisters adjusted by setting their own sights even higher. Rita is preparing to embark on a doctorate and Ginette moved into management and began to consider medical school. It seems clear to Ginette that she may remain the top earner in her marriage&#x2014;or at least the one with the more reliable paycheck&#x2014;so she might as well maximize that income as a doctor rather than a nurse. &#x201c;I want to do it,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I want to make more money. I might as well do it. I know it&#x2019;s a lot of work. I understand.&#x201d;<br> <br>Or meet Jill Singer, raised on a farm on the outskirts of Boise, Idaho, with the expectation that she would work hard in life but should not expect to earn much for her labor, because earning money was a man&#x2019;s domain. When she was growing up in the 1970s, Jill and her sisters were expected to do agricultural chores alongside their brothers. &#x201c;By the time we were tall enough to push a lawn mower, that&#x2019;s when we started working,&#x201d; Jill remembers. &#x201c;But we were also supposed to do inside chores. The boys could come inside and sit, but the girls were expected to do cooking and sewing and mend the shirts.&#x201d; She was raised in the Mormon Church, which&#x2014;like a number of traditional religions&#x2014;teaches that the husband provides for, and presides over, the family. Growing up, Jill learned that public space belonged to men and private domestic space to women. &#x201c;Men were responsible for the &#x2018;outside&#x2019;&#x2014;income and discipline&#x2014;and women were responsible for the &#x2018;inside&#x2019;&#x2014;budgeting for a household, raising the children, staying home and making sure the husband is happy,&#x201d; is how Jill summarizes her upbringing. &#x201c;I was never led to expect that I would be a primary breadwinner. Ever.&#x201d; Yet Jill now works in construction management and earns twice as much as her husband. Thumbtacked to a bulletin board in her mud room is the church&#x2019;s proclamation on the family, which articulates the man-as-provider philosophy. She doesn&#x2019;t pay much attention to it&#x2014;believing that it has nothing to do with church doctrine, and everything to do with church politics&#x2014;and expects any day now to be relieved of her duties as a Sunday school teacher, relating gospel principles to children on the verge of being baptized. She tells her daughters, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t believe everything that comes from the pulpit.&#x201d; All three of her sisters, she notes, make the bulk of their family income.<br> <br>&#x201c;My parents are so pleased with us,&#x201d; says Jill. &#x201c;They are tickled pink at how we women turned out.&#x201d;<br> <br>And finally, consider four young women sitting at an outdoor table in midtown Atlanta, Georgia, on a balmy Saturday in late winter. Two are engineers, one is a banker, and another is an entrepreneur. All are in their early twenties. All earn between $65,000 and $90,000, just a couple of years out of college. In most American cities, single childless women between 22 and 30 make more, in terms of median income, than their male peers, a direct result of the fact that women are now better-educated than men. Of all the major cities where young women outearn young men, Atlanta is number one. Well do these women know the accuracy of that statistic. &#x201c;I have never had a boyfriend who made more than me,&#x201d; says one of them. Over steak salads and spring rolls, the Atlanta women share techniques on how to make the men they date feel comfortable, and as they talk it becomes clear they are also describing how they make themselves feel comfortable. One likes to let her boyfriend drive her car. She carries lots of petty cash&#x2014;singles and fives&#x2014;so she can discreetly pay for tips and parking and entrance fees in a way that seems less obtrusive than flashing around a credit card. &#x201c;You never actually show them how much money it&#x2019;s costing,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;You never want them to be aware of how much work you&#x2019;re putting in.&#x201d;<br> <br>She adds: &#x201c;I want at the end of the night for someone not to remember who paid.&#x201d;<br> <br>Another woman at the table buys movie tickets in advance, and then tells her boyfriend they were given away at work. This same woman recently got a promotion at the consulting company she works for, along with a raise higher than she expected. She struggled to know how to share this with her boyfriend, a manager at a Waffle House who took that job because it was the only one he could find that was near her. She loves her work, and her boyfriend hates his, and the day after her big news he was in tears over how thankless and chaotic his own job is. How do you handle that? How do you celebrate you...</p><h2>Flying to the Moon: An Astronaut&#39;s Story</h2><p><p>In this entrancing account, space traveler Michael Collins recalls his early days as an Air Force test pilot, his astronaut training at NASA, and his unparalleled experiences in orbit, including the Apollo 11 mission, the first manned lunar landing. The final chapter to his autobiography, revised and updated for this edition of <i>Flying to the Moon</i>, is an exciting and convincing argument in favor of mankind's continued exploration of our universe. </p><p>"Several astronauts have written about their experiences, but none so well as Michael Collins...This is just the book to give the child whose parents made Yeager and The Right Stuff best sellers."-The Washington Post Book World</p></p><p><p><b>Michael Collins</b> flew in both the <i>Gemini 10</i> and <i>Apollo 11</i> space missions in the 1960s. He currently lives in South Florida.</p>Flying To the Moon <br> <i>1</i> Early on the morning of July 20, 1969, I was circling the moon with Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin in our spacecraft <i>Columbia</i>. We had just awakened from a short sleep and were sucking lukewarm coffee out of plastic tubes and munching on bacon which had been squeezed into little cubes, like lumps of sugar. While we were eating our breakfast, we were talking on the radio with our friends in Mission Control in Houston, Texas. Today was the day Neil and Buzz were going to land on the moon, and Houston was giving them some last-minute advice. Mostly it was technical stuff about their schedule, but all of a sudden they said, " ... watch out for a lovely girlwith a big rabbit. An ancient legend says a beautiful Chinese girl called Chang-O has been living there for four thousand years. It seems she was banished to the moon because she stole the pill of immortality from her husband. You might also look for her companion, a large Chinese rabbit, who is easy to spot since he is always standing on his hind feet in the shade of a cinnamon tree." Of course, our friends in Houston were kidding, because the moon doesn't have any cinnamon trees or even any air for people or rabbits to breathe. They probably just wanted to make us laugh a little bit so we wouldn't be too nervous about landing on the moon for the first time ever. We <i>were</i> a little nervous that morning. We were concerned about how well our spacecraft and computers would work. We also worried about the rocket blast from <i>Eagle</i>, our lunar module, which might kick up a lot of dust and prevent Neil Armstrong from being able to see well enough to land. Or suppose Neil couldn't find a spot smooth and level enough to put <i>Eagle</i> down? As it turned out, we need not have worried about the moon, because the <i>Eagle</i> landed beautifully in the Sea of Tranquility, and Neil and Buzz were able to walk around and collect some rocks. The moon's surface didn't surprise us, because people had studied the moon very carefully long before Project Apollo came along. In fact, as long as there have been human beings, I suspect that they have wondered about the moon. How far away was it? How big? What was it made of? How could one visit it? It looked like a shining silver plate hanging in the sky, and on a clear night it seemed almost close enough that a cow could jump over it. But really it is far away--nearly a quarter of a million milesfrom earth. Before anyone visited the moon, scientists made very accurate measurements of its distance. How can you tell how far away something is when you haven't even been there? There are at least two ways. One is to get two people on different sides of the earth to look at the moon at the same time and measure where it appears with respect to the stars in the background; that is, which stars appear next to it. By comparing what the two observers see, it is possible to measure an angle--called parallax. Once the parallax angle and the distance between the observers are known, it is possible to draw a triangle and calculate the distance to the moon: Another way is to bounce a radar signal off the moon and measure the time it takes the signal to travel from the earth to the moon and back again. Since radio waves always travel at the same speed (the speed of light), it is easy to calculate the distance if you know the time. Scientists over the years used both the parallax and the radar methods and got the same answer: 238,000 miles from the earth to the moon. That's a long, long way, and yet it took Neil and Buzz and me only three days to get there, so you know we must have been traveling pretty fast. The reason we were able to go so fast is that we started out riding on a rocket--a huge rocket taller than a football Held standing on end. As the rocket's engines blasted away, we left the earth slowly and then got going faster and faster until finally we had enough speed to overpower the pull of the earth's gravity. By this time, the rocket had used all its fuel, so we separated from it and floated to the moon in the weightlessness of space. Of course, huge rockets weren't invented until fairly recently, and man has always wanted to go to the moon, so you might guess that there were a number of crazy schemes thought up before the rocket came along. My favorite would-be astronaut was Cyrano de Bergerac, a Frenchman who lived over three hundred years ago. His idea was to get up early in the morning and gather up dew from his garden. He would put the dew into tiny bottles and strap the bottles to his body. Then, when the morning sun's heat caused the dew to evaporate, he would float up with it--to the moon. Another famous Frenchman was Jules Verne, who was born about a hundred and fifty years ago. His idea was to shoot a moonship out of a huge cannon, which he called the <i>Columbiad.</i> Verne wrote a fascinating make-believe story about a trip to the moon, and many of his ideas came close to the way the Apollo flights actually took place. For example, as a location for his <i>Columbiad</i> he picked, of all places on earth, Tampa, Florida--just a few miles west of Cape Canaveral, the launching pad for our <i>Columbia</i>. As I circled the moon in July of 1969, I was thinking about Armstrong and Aldrin, not de Bergerac and Verne. O.K., so we were 238,000 miles from earth, that much Iknew, but what would Neil and Buzz find on the surface? No one had ever been there before, and I was worried, even though we did have a lot of information to help us. Ever since Galileo first peered at the moon through his telescope, nearly four hundred years ago, we had been gathering facts about its pock-marked surface. We had photographs of it, and maps, too. We had crashed into it with our Ranger unmanned spacecraft and even soft-landed a Surveyor spacecraft loaded with instruments. We knew it had no atmosphere and we knew its surface could be either colder than Siberia in January or hotter than the Sahara Desert in August. Whether any one spot on its surface was hot or cold depended on its angle to the sun. The moon does not spin, but keeps one side pointed toward the earth as it makes a gigantic circle around the earth. It takes the moon one month to go around the earth once. In the meantime, the earth is making an even bigger <i>(much</i> bigger) circle around the sun. What all this means is that in a month's time a spot on the moon's surface will be exposed to every possible condition of lighting--from inky black to sunlight directly overhead ("noon"). Months before our flight, scientists had picked a landing spot that looked nice and smooth. Then they figured what time of the month we should arrive at that spot. We wanted Neil and Buzz to be able to see well, with the sun behind them as they descended, and we wanted them not to get too hot, so we decided that landing just after dawn would be best. As you look at the full moon, if you use your imagination you can see the face of the Man in the Moon. Neil and Buzz would be landing just below his left eye. On the day they landed,his left eye was barely visible and his right eye was in darkness. In other words, the people on earth would see slightly less than a half-moon. It's hard for me to explain exactly what a half-moon is without drawing a picture. Remember that the moon produces no light of its own, but merely bounces back sunlight which hits its surface, so you can tell the direction of the sun by looking at the moon: You can see that the moon always has one half lighted and one half dark. The reason it looks different to us is that, as it goes around the earth in its circular orbit, its angle to the sun keeps changing, and sometimes we see only the light side ("full moon") or only the dark side ("new moon") or half and half or mostly dark ("crescent moon") or mostly light ("gibbous moon"). See if you can tell which is which by looking at my diagram. I have shown two crescentmoons, two gibbous moons, two half-moons, but only one full and one new moon. That is because a crescent or a gibbous or a half-moon can be either waxing (its light part getting larger), or waning (its light part getting smaller). When I was young, I only thought a little bit about why the moon changed shape as the month wore on, I <i>never</i> thought about what the earth would look like when seen from the moon. The planet earth produces no light of its own, but merely reflects sunlight, just as the moon does. Sure enough, coming back from the moon, I could look out my spacecraft window and see a crescent earth. The moon is not nearly as large as the earth, and therefore its gravity is not as strong. Any object, such as a human body, is attracted more strongly to a large planet than to a small one. On earth I weigh 165 pounds, but on the moon I would weigh only 27 pounds. Imagine a grown man weighing 27 pounds! That is why Neil and Buzz were able to jump around like kangaroos on the moon, even though they were loaded down with heavy equipment. Now, on the surface of Jupiter, which is the largest planet in our solar system, I would weigh 436 pounds. A person would have a difficult time standing up on Jupiter, much less jumping around. Before we got to the moon we had a pretty good idea of what we would find--rocks, and more rocks. We knew this from photographs taken on earth through telescopes, and also those taken by spacecraft from up close. Neil and Buzz should have taken a small piece of green cheese with them from earth, just so they could say they had brought some green cheese back from the moon. In addition to being all rocks, another bad thing about the moon is that there isno air to breathe. We didn't think there was any water either, although we weren't too sure about that. With no air or water, the moon would be a very difficult place for humans to live, or even visit. Neil and Buzz carried their own breathing supply of oxygen in packs on their backs. If someone wanted to live on the moon more or less permanently, that person would probably have to put up a plastic bubble, fill it with air, and stay inside it. The moon would be a great place to observe the stars because there is no atmosphere to get in the way and block the view. On earth, we think we can see the stars clearly, but we really can't. Over 90 percent of the energy coming from the stars is blocked out by our atmosphere and never reaches the ground. On the moon, with no atmosphere, astronomers would not have this problem, and they would be able to learn a lot more about our universe. Of course, it's going to be a long, long time before astronomers or anyone else begins to live on the moon inside bubbles. It would be very complicated and expensive to get all the necessary equipment up there. It took us eight years from the time President John F. Kennedy said we should go to the moon until Neil stepped on it. It took me six years of training as a NASA astronaut to learn everything I needed to know to make the trip. That is a long time to study, especially when you know you absolutely must pass the final exam. But along the way I learned a lot of fascinating things, like how to find food in the jungle, and I would like to tell you about some of them. <i>Copyright � 1994, 1976 by Michael Collins</i></p><h2>Engineering Mathematics</h2><p>Since the publication of the third edition of &#34;Engineering Mathematics&#34;, considerable changes in syllabuses and options for A level qualifications in mathematics have been introduced nationally, as a result of which students with various levels of mathematical background have been enrolling for undergraduate courses in engineering and science.

On the occasion of Emerson's 200th birthday, Lawrence Buell revisits the life of the nation's first public intellectual and discovers how he became a "representative man."</p><p>Born into the age of inspired amateurism that emerged from the ruins of pre-revolutionary political, religious, and cultural institutions, Emerson took up the challenge of thinking about the role of the United States alone and in the world. With characteristic authority and grace, Buell conveys both the style and substance of Emerson's accomplishment--in his conception of America as the transplantation of Englishness into the new world, and in his prodigious work as writer, religious thinker, and philosopher. Here we see clearly the paradoxical key to his success, the fierce insistence on independence that acted so magnetically upon all around him. Steeped in Emerson's writings, and in the life and lore of the America of his day, Buell's book is as individual--and as compelling--as its subject. At a time when Americans and non-Americans alike are struggling to understand what this country is, and what it is about, <i>Emerson</i> gives us an answer in the figure of this representative American, an American for all, and for all times.</p></p><p>Lawrence Buell is Powell M.

In recent years, however, the study of affect has come into its own as a vigorous, respectable, and productive branch of scientific psychology, and with this shift has come a new interest in emotions such as shame, guilt, embarrassment, and pride. This volume provides a comprehensive, in-depth review of the current theoretical and empirical literature on these emotions. It brings together contributions from leading researchers and theoreticians from the fields of developmental psychology, clinical psychology, psychiatry, and sociology, reflecting the emerging coherence in this area of study.<br>The introduction provides a general framework for conceptualization and research on the self-conscious emotions. The book then addresses developmental issues, including the nature of these affective experiences among children, from late infancy to middle childhood, and implications for children's psychosocial functioning. Detailed explorations of the relationship of self-conscious emotions to aspects of social behavior and the social environment and to various types of psychopathology are also presented. Chapters demonstrate how an understanding of self-conscious emotions can greatly enhance the treatment of a wide range of maladaptive patterns of behavior, including marital conflict, depression, anxiety, and antisocial behavior. The final section discusses cross-cultural continuities and discontinuities in self-conscious affect. Throughout, the book highlights the need for innovative and diverse methodologies to systematically study the nature and functions of these feelings.<br>The unique focus on empirical approaches makes this work an invaluable resource for the growing number of researchers interested in the study of self-conscious affect and social behavior. Demonstrating the wide-ranging implications of this research for clinical practice, the book will interest practitioners in clinical psychology, psychiatry, and developmental psychology. In addition, <i>Self-Conscious Emotions</i> will benefit professionals in social psychology, sociology, and anthropology, and will serve as useful text for courses in the psychology of emotion, personality and emotion, and cultural psychology. <br></p><p>June Price Tangney, PhD is Associate Professor of Psychology at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia. Since receiving her doctorate in clinical psychology from UCLA in 1985, she has conducted research on the development and implications of shame and guilt. More recently, her work has focused on the links between shame and constructive versus destructive responses to anger. Her research has been fidned by grants from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and her papers have appeared in numerous professional journals.<br>Kurt W. Fischer, PhD, is Professor of Education in the Department of Human Development and Psychology at Harvard University, where he is leading an initiative to focus on diversity in development and its implications for education. Coeditor (with Geraldine Dawson) of <i>Human Behavior and the Developing Brain</i>, he previously served as a Fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford, where he organized a group on Dynamic Modeling of Growth and Development.<br>"I have not seen a better collection of papers on shame, embarrassment, guilt, and pride. Many different perspectives are represented in eighteen well-written chapters including developmental, cross-cultural, and narrative approaches. The book reports on cutting-edge research concerning a topic of interest in social, personality, developmental, and clinical psychology. Every student of human emotions will want a copy." --Peter Salovey, PhD, Associate Professor of Psychology and Director of Graduate Studies in Psychology, Yale University.<br><br>"This book is an important contribution to the growing literature on the emotions, which should be read by emotion theorists and researchers, especially those with a special interest in what the editors call the self-conscious emotions. These include shame, embarrassment, guilt, and pride. The editors correctly point out that these emotions have been, to some extent, ignored in the study of the emotions. The authors of the chapters constitute a who's-who of social scientists who have contributed substantially to our understanding of one or more of these emotions. This volume is one of the best and most up-to-date sourcebooks containing current ideas and empirical research on them." --Richard S. Lazarus, Ph.D., Professor Emeritus, University of California at Berkeley<br><br>"I found the book comprehensive in that it includes the development of self conscious emotions, clinical applications, and cultural differences. There was a nice mixture of older and newer investigators. It is an important sourcebook for researchers or anyone interested in shame, guilt, pride, and embarrassment." --Arnold Buss, Ph.D., University of Texas<br><br>"This timely book brings together many of the top names in the field of emotion to examine shame, guilt, embarrassment, and pride. This endeavor helps to redress a disturbing neglect of these important emotions and their social significance. The content-rich chapters range in focus from emotional development to cultural influence, yet each contributes to our understanding of the antecedents of these critical emotional experiences and their consequences for social conduct." --Bernard Weiner, Ph.D., University of California, Los Angeles <br></p><h2>Voyages from the Past: A History of Passengers at Sea</h2><p>A social history of sea travel from the passengers&#x2019; perspective, encompassing all walks of life and vessels departing from a variety of UK ports.

Focusing primarily on China and including discussion of India, Duara argues that many historians of postcolonial nation-states have adopted a linear, evolutionary history of the Enlightenment/colonial model. As a result, they have written repressive, exclusionary, and incomplete accounts.<br> <br> The backlash against such histories has resulted in a tendency to view the past as largely constructed, imagined, or invented. In this book, Duara offers a way out of the impasse between constructionism and the evolving nation; he redefines history as a series of multiple, often conflicting narratives produced simultaneously at national, local, and transnational levels. In a series of closely linked case studies, he considers such examples as the very different histories produced by Chinese nationalist reformers and partisans of popular religions, the conflicting narratives of statist nationalists and of advocates of federalism in early twentieth-century China. He demonstrates the necessity of incorporating contestation, appropriation, repression, and the return of the repressed subject into any account of the past that will be meaningful to the present. Duara demonstrates how to write histories that resist being pressed into the service of the national subject in its progress&#x2014;or stalled progress&#x2014;toward modernity.</p></p><p><b>Prasenjit Duara</b> is chair of the department of history at the University of chicago.

But just as you need to put on your own oxygen mask before helping other passengers on an airplane, getting your own life together is the first step to making a positive impact in the world. Franklin Covey cofounder Hyrum Smith shows that what stops us are gaps between where we are and where we want to be. The first is the Beliefs Gap, between what we believe to be true and what is actually true. The second is the Values Gap, between what we value most in life and what we actually spend our life doing. The third is the Time Gap, between what we plan to do each day and what we actually get done. <br><br> Smith offers a practical blueprint that we all can use to recognize and close each of these three gaps and illustrates how it can be done through inspiring true stories. <i>The 3 Gaps</i> provides the concepts and the tools needed to establish a solid foundation from which you can help make the world a better place.</p><p>In a world of persistent and often overwhelming chaos, this book makes one simple promise: If you close the gaps in the three areas of your life, you will achieve fulfillment, success, and inner peace.Hyrum W. Smith is the cofounder and former Chairman and CEO of Franklin Covey and the cofounder of 3Gaps, a personal and organizational training company. He is also the author of several nationally acclaimed books, including The 10 Natural Laws of Successful Time and Life Management, What Matters Most, and You Are What You Believe.</p><h2>Krazy: George Herriman, a Life in Black and White</h2><p><p>In the tradition of <em>Schulz and Peanuts</em>, an epic and revelatory biography of Krazy Kat creator George Herriman that explores the turbulent time and place from which he emerged&#x2014;and the deep secret he explored through his art.</p><p>The creator of the greatest comic strip in history finally gets his due&#x2014;in an eye-opening biography that lays bare the truth about his art, his heritage, and his life on America&#x2019;s color line. A native of nineteenth-century New Orleans, George Herriman came of age as an illustrator, journalist, and cartoonist in the boomtown of Los Angeles and the wild metropolis of New York. Appearing in the biggest newspapers of the early twentieth century&#x2014;including those owned by William Randolph Hearst&#x2014;Herriman&#x2019;s Krazy Kat cartoons quickly propelled him to fame. Although fitfully popular with readers of the period, his work has been widely credited with elevating cartoons from daily amusements to anarchic art. </p><p>Herriman used his work to explore the human condition, creating a modernist fantasia that was inspired by the landscapes he discovered in his travels&#x2014;from chaotic urban life to the Beckett-like desert vistas of the Southwest. Yet underlying his own life&#x2014;and often emerging from the contours of his very public art&#x2014;was a very private secret: known as "the Greek" for his swarthy complexion and curly hair, Herriman was actually African American, born to a prominent Creole family that hid its racial identity in the dangerous days of Reconstruction. </p><p>Drawing on exhaustive original research into Herriman&#x2019;s family history, interviews with surviving friends and family, and deep analysis of the artist&#x2019;s work and surviving written records, Michael Tisserand brings this little-understood figure to vivid life, paying homage to a visionary artist who helped shape modern culture. </p></p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of December 2016:</strong> <em>Krazy: A Life in Black and White</em> is the exhaustively researched and fascinating story of a trailblazer with a secret. Nicknamed &#x201c;The Greek&#x201d; by a fellow cartoonist, owing to his swarthy complexion and curly hair (which he typically kept hidden under a fedora), it wasn&#x2019;t until George Herriman, creator of the perpetually lovestruck Krazy Kat, had been dead for twenty-seven years that a would-be biographer discovered the secret Herriman had guarded all his life. He was the product of a mixed-race marriage, and had, like two generations of Herrimans before him, been able to &#x201c;pass for white.&#x201d; The creator of a comic strip that has been infinitely more influential among cartoonists and intellectuals than it was popular with the American public (the strips only appeared in newspapers for twenty years because newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst was such a fan he gave Herriman a lifetime contract; a visitor to Herriman&#x2019;s editor found an office junior sopping up a water leak with original Krazy Kat art), this new biography finally gives Herriman his due and frames him as a visionary whose influence helped shape popular culture for decades after his death. It takes a fresh and knowing look at the cheerfully subversive cartoons involving the put-upon but loving black cat and his white, brick-throwing love/nemesis. In addition, Tisserand provides eye-opening dimension with regard to the scale of Herriman&#x2019;s influence: Michael Chabon, Will Eisner, Charles Schulz, ee cummings and many others credit him with inspiring their work (you may never look at the zigzag on Charlie Brown&#x2019;s t-shirt again without remembering that it was Charles Schulz&#x2019;s tribute to the Navaho designs that recurred in Herriman&#x2019;s work). Ultimately, the reader comes away with a sobering idea of what an exhausting job it must have been for a gentle genius, living on the color line in the first half of twentieth century America, pursuing a career and a point of view that never would have been open to him had his true racial identity been known. <em>&#x2014;Vannessa Cronin, The Amazon Book Review</em><p>In this Eisner Award&#x2013;winning biography of <em>Krazy Kat</em> creator George Herriman, the man behind one of the greatest comic strips in history finally gets his due. Michael Tisserand celebrates Herriman&#x2019;s wondrous comics while delving deep into the life of a cartoonist on America&#x2019;s color line. <strong></strong></p><p>A native of nineteenth-century New Orleans, George Herriman came of age as a cartoonist in the boomtown of Los Angeles and the wild metropolis of New York.

This beautifully clarifying keystone anthology, therefore, couldn&#x2019;t be more timely in its illumination of the full Latino spectrum in exceptional literature rooted in Chicano, Puerto Rican, Cuban American, and Dominican American cultures, as well in other Spanish-speaking countries. Prolific and versatile Stavans and his fellow editors have gathered a glorious chorus of 201 voices spanning five centuries and diverse traditions. Stavans lays the groundwork: &#x201c;First, at its core, Latino literature is about the tension between double attachments to place, to language, and to identity.&#x201d; Stavans and company subsequently track the interaction between Hispanic and Anglo perspectives as they succinctly yet vividly cover the historical and political events that have shaped and fueled Latino writing both reportorial and imaginative. With a great array of writers celebrated and too little known, and invaluable supporting materials, this grand and affecting treasury of culturally rich and aesthetically dynamic poems, fiction, drama, letters, diaries, and essays illuminates every aspect of Latino life. While the great poet Jos� Mart� writes of &#x201c;weapons of the mind, which vanquish all others,&#x201d; journalist Rub�n Mart�nez begins his chronicle of the Mexican-U.S. border with a sentence laced with profound implications: &#x201c;I am close to the line.&#x201d; --Donna Seaman</p><h2>Forensic Analytics: Methods and Techniques for Forensic Accounting Investigations</h2><p><b>Discover how to detect fraud, biases, or errors in your data using Access or Excel</b> <p>With over 300 images, <i>Forensic Analytics</i> reviews and shows how twenty substantive and rigorous tests can be used to detect fraud, errors, estimates, or biases in your data.

Themes central to all of<br>Derrida&#x2019;s writings thread the intense confrontation between the most famous<br>philosopher of our time and the Jewish poet writing in German who, perhaps<br>more powerfully than any other, has testified to the European experience of<br>the twentieth century.</p><p>They include the date or signature and its singularity; the notion of the trace;<br>temporal structures of futurity and the &#x201c;to come&#x201d;; the multiplicity of language<br>and questions of translation; such speech acts as testimony and promising, but<br>also lying and perjury; the possibility of the impossible; and, above all, the question<br>of the poem as addressed and destined beyond knowledge, seeking to speak to<br>and for the irreducibly other.</p><p>The memory of encounters with thinkers who have also engaged Celan&#x2019;s work<br>animates these writings, which include a brilliant dialogue between two<br>interpretative modes&#x2015;hermeneutics and deconstruction. Derrida&#x2019;s approach to<br>a poem is a revelation on many levels, from the most concrete ways of reading<br>&#x2015;for example, his analysis of a sequence of personal pronouns&#x2015;to the most<br>sweeping imperatives of human existence (and Derrida&#x2019;s writings are always<br>a study in the imbrication of such levels). Above all, he voices the call to<br>responsibility in the ultimate line of Celan&#x2019;s poem: &#x201c;The world is gone,<br>I must carry you,&#x201d; which sounds throughout the book&#x2019;s final essay like a refrain.</p><p>Only two of the texts in this volume do not appear here in English for the first time.

Woolf herself called it 'a writer's holiday', in which she tosses Vita 'from on sex to another, dresses her in furs, lace and emeralds, and ends by photographing her in the mud at Long Barn, with dogs, awaiting Virginia's arrival next day'.</p><p>An extravagant incarnation of Vita's personality, Orlando &#x2013; first seen as a dashing young man at the court of Elizabeth I &#x2013; weaves in and out of the next three centuries, slipping between genders, emerging as a woman during the Restoration and continuing life as a woman to the present day. Alongside the play-fullness and wit of 'Orlando' is a fierce and spirited statement about gender and cultural conditioning. First masculine, then feminine, a man of action, a lady of fashion, Orlando begins to realise that in his former life, he was free and content but, as a woman, chaste, scented and exquisitely apparelled.'

Steel and Gardiner's mission to uphold Victorian standards in Indian kitchens has illuminating parallels with the running of the British Empire, and their domestic guide reveals as much about British attitudes to India as any history book on the Raj. In this treasure trove of household advice for young British memsahibs, they explain how to "make a hold" over servants, establish and stock a storeroom, plan a menu, manage young children, treat bites from "mad, or even doubtful dogs," and teach an Indian cook how to make fish <em>quenelles</em>. Whether living in camps or the jungle, on the hills or in the plains, no British woman would be at a loss with <em>The Complete Indian</em> <em>Housekeeper and Cook</em> by her side. For this new edition, the editors provide a lively Introduction and notes that offer an invaluable guide to the manual.</p><p><br><strong>Ralph Crane</strong> is Professor of English at the University of Tasmania.<br> <strong>Anna Johnston</strong> is Research Fellow and Senior Lecturer in English at the University of Tasmania.<br>Their mission, to create a domestic space that was forever Wiltshire, throws a bright light on the larger project of which they were a part, that of running the British Empire.

The MIT Encyclopedia of the Cognitive Sciences (MITECS) is a landmark, comprehensive reference work that represents the methodological and theoretical diversity of this changing field. At the core of the encyclopedia are 471 concise entries, from Acquisition and Adaptationism to Wundt and X-bar Theory. Each article, written by a leading researcher in the field, provides an accessible introduction to an important concept in the cognitive sciences, as well as references or further readings. Six extended essays, which collectively serve as a roadmap to the articles, provide overviews of each of six major areas of cognitive science: Philosophy; Psychology; Neurosciences; Computational Intelligence; Linguistics and Language; and Culture, Cognition, and Evolution. For both students and researchers, MITECS will be an indispensable guide to the current state of the cognitive sciences.</p></p><p>The state-of-the-art knowledge about knowledge is contained within the <i>MIT Encyclopedia of the Cognitive Sciences</i>. Its 471 comprehensive entries cover topics as diverse as "Hemispheric Specialization," "Epiphenomenalism," and "Algorithms" in 1,000 to 1,500 words each, thoroughly cross-indexed and extensively referenced to launch further research. A few biographical entries are also included, highlighting such giants as Alan Turing and Santiago Ram�n y Cajal. The editors selected their contributors well, assigning "Neurobiology of Consciousness" to Christof Koch and Francis Crick, for example. Even better, six longer essays introduce the <i>Encyclopedia</i>, each providing an overview of one of the six disciplines that overlap to form cognitive science: computational intelligence; culture, cognition, and evolution; linguistics and language; neurosciences; philosophy; and psychology. These are enormously helpful to the researcher, as they are general enough to allow easy entry but still meaty enough to be useful themselves and as pointers to specific entries. The <i>MIT Encyclopedia of the Cognitive Sciences</i>, while not a casual entry into the field, is an essential addition to the reference shelf for anyone seriously interested in AI, consciousness, or other aspects of natural and artificial brains. <i>--Rob Lightner</i>Robert A.

Unique in its wide-ranging attention to economic, social, intellectual, and cultural dimensions, it is the first book to treat Indochina's entire history from its inception in Cochinchina in 1858 to its crumbling at Dien Bien Ph in 1954 and on to decolonization. Basing their account on original research as well as on the most recent scholarship, Pierre Brocheux and Daniel H�mery tell this story from a perspective that is neither Eurocentric nor nationalistic but that carefully considers the positions of both the colonizers and the colonized. With this approach, they are able to move beyond descriptive history into a rich exploration of the ambiguities and complexities of the French colonial period in Indochina. Rich in themes and ideas, their account also sheds new light on the national histories of the emerging nation-states of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, making this book essential reading for students, scholars, and general readers interested in the region, in the Vietnam War, or in French imperialism, among other topics.<br><br>Caption translations provided in part by Nina Fink. <br><br></p><p>"An important, well-conceived, and original piece of historical synthesis."&#x2015;Peter Zinoman, author of <i>The Colonial Bastille: A History of Imprisonment in Vietnam</i><br><br>&#x201c;<i>Indochina</i> is the first and best general history of French colonial Indochina from its inception in 1858 to its crumbling in 1954.

Unions have seemed powerless to defend their members, with big defeats in the strikes at PATCO, Eastern Airlines, International Paper, and Hormel. Ravenswood recounts how the United Steelworkers of America, in a battle waged over an aluminum plant in West Virginia, proved that organized labor can still win&#x2015;even against a company controlled by one of the world's richest and most powerful men. Fast paced and compellingly written, the book provides an insider's look at the new tactics that many hope will revitalize the struggle for workers' rights in America.</p><p>On November 1, 1990, just as its contract with the United Steelworkers of America was about to expire, Ravenswood Aluminum Corporation locked out its seventeen hundred employees and hired permanent replacements. Despite deteriorating conditions that had led to five deaths in the previous year, the company had refused to discuss safety and health issues. The locked-out workers faced an industry in turmoil, a plant manager with a grudge against the union, and a business controlled by a billionaire fugitive from justice. Tom Juravich and Kate Bronfenbrenner describe how victory was achieved through the commitment of the workers and their families coupled with one of the most innovative contract campaigns ever waged by an American union.</p></p><p>Ravenswood recounts how the United Steelworkers of America, in a battle waged over an aluminum plant in West Virginia, proved that organized labor can still win - even against a company controlled by one of the world&#39;s richest and most powerful men.

Culminating in the spectacular incineration of a wooden effigy, this festival is grand-scale theater for self-expression, personal transformation, eclectic spirituality, communal bonding, and cultural renewal. In this engrossing ethnography of the Burning Man phenomenon, Lee Gilmore explores why &#x201c;burners&#x201d; come in vast numbers to transform a temporary gathering of strangers into an enduring community. Accompanied by a DVD, which provides panoramic views of events, individuals, artworks, and, of course, the climactic final night, the book delves into the varieties of spirituality, ritual, and performance conducted within the festival space.</p><p>"Gilmore's study brings new voices and experiences to current debates about religion versus spirituality through her richly textured descriptions of the characters, events, and spaces that make up the seemingly strange but culturally significant Burning Man festival. Readers will discover that Burning Man is a wonderful illustration of the dialectic between self and community at the heart of much of American religion today. Gilmore persuades us that those who trivialize this event by seeing it as a huge party, miss the ways in which Burning Man provides an unusual snapshot of diverse forms of American spiritual-seeking."&#x2015;Sarah Pike, author of <i>Earthly Bodies, Magical Selves: Contemporary Pagans and the Search for Community</i><br><br>"At the generative core of research in ritual studies is a balancing act: on the one hand, involved; on the other, distanced.

The result was not only a superb collection of photographs but a breathtakingly vivid written portrait of India, Burma, and China at a historic turning-point in their histories. These volumes integrate both elements fully for the first time, offering the complete text of Beaton's narrative and a truly comprehensive selection of over 200 photographs.<br> Beaton was a great observer and, perhaps unexpectedly, a great describer. In remarkably few words, he can make you see, hear, smell, almost touch the dusty Burmese countryside, the shimmering, casual magnificence of a Bombay virtually untouched by war, or the rain-sodden, flea-bitten front lines in a China nearly destroyed by it. He was an acute observer of people, too, and these books offer revealing glimpses of representative wartime figures from Madame Sun Yat-sen and General Claire Chennault to anonymous British soldiers and Chinese peasants. There is mayhem, including an electrifying description of what it's like to live through a plane crash, and mordant social comedy that rivals (and explains much of) <em>The Jewel in the Crown</em>. Perhaps best of all are Beaton's accounts of the two great invariants of modern war--waiting for transport and enduring it--in all their exquisite variety.<br> A magnificent record of some of Beaton's most austere and disciplined photography and a welcome reminder of his almost forgotten literary gifts, these books offer a uniquely real picture of one of the most heroic episodes of recent history.</p><p></p><h2>Alexander Gardner: The Western Photographs, 1867&#x2013;1868 (Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art)</h2><p><b>A glimpse into the development of the American West through startling photographs of the frontier landscape and the rich culture of American Indian tribes &nbsp;</b><br><br> Best known for his Civil War photographs, Alexander Gardner (1821&#x2013;1882) also created two extraordinary bodies of work depicting the transformation of the American West: <i>Across the Continent on the Kansas Pacific Railway</i> and <i>Scenes in the Indian County</i>. In 1867, after joining the survey team for what became the Kansas Pacific Railroad, Gardner photographed the path of the proposed extension, emphasizing the ease of future railroad construction and economic development, while including studies of American Indians and settlements along the way. The following year, Gardner recorded peace talks with Indian tribes at Fort Laramie, Wyoming. Distinctly sympathetic to the plight of the American Indian, Gardner made candid documentation of individual chiefs, their encampments and daily life, burial trees, and the peace proceedings themselves. With a full catalogue raisonn� of these two rare series, <i>Alexander Gardner</i> offers a complete visual index of these remarkable photographs, made at a critical moment in the history of the American West.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>This remarkable volume offers an extraordinary glimpse into the transformation of the American West through startling photographs of the landscape of the frontier and the rich culture of rapidly marginalized American Indian tribes.<br><b>Jane L.

As the favored artist of an enterprising Parisian elite, Robert is a prophetic case study of the intersections between aesthetics and modernity&#x2019;s dawning business culture.<br><br>At the center of this lively narrative lie Robert&#x2019;s depictions of the ruins of Paris&#x2014;macabre and spectacular paintings of fires and demolitions created on the eve of the French Revolution. Drawing on a vast range of materials, <i>Futures &amp; Ruins</i> understands these artworks as harbingers of a modern appetite for destruction. The paintings are examined as expressions of the pleasures and perils of a risk economy.

Until publication of this book, there had been little documentation of the trail. Such giants of the route as Jedediah Smith and Peter Skene Ogden have come down in history. But the leaders on the trail were indifferent reporters and their followers -- an ethnic crazy quilt of Englishmen, Scots, Irish, French-Canadians, Mexicans, black Americans, Iroquois, Abenaki, half-breeds, and kanakas from Hawaii -- were lucky if they could write their names. Nevertheless, the explorations, the discoveries, the incredible hardships, the adventures, the occasional humor which lit up the treks like sun after a heavy rain -- all interweave to make this a towering tale, its truth attested by the primary sources which Richard Dillon has researched.</p><p></p><h2>Jane Seymour&#39;s Guide to Romantic Living</h2><p>Explains how to achieve a romantic lifestyle by bringing novelty, joy, romance, and surprise back into the routines of everyday life</p><p></p><h2>COMPLETE WRITING GUIDE PB</h2><p>Collins Complete Writing Guide</p><p>Graham King was formerly a senior marketing manager with News International, where he developed an understanding of the need to express oneself with clarity.

Our incarceration rate&#x2015;at 714 per 100,000 residents and rising&#x2015;is almost forty percent greater than our nearest competitors (the Bahamas, Belarus, and Russia). More pointedly, it is 6.2 times the Canadian rate and 12.3 times the rate in Japan. Economist Glenn Loury argues that this extraordinary mass incarceration is not a response to rising crime rates or a proud success of social policy. Instead, it is the product of a generation-old collective decision to become a more punitive society. He connects this policy to our history of racial oppression, showing that the punitive turn in American politics and culture emerged in the post-civil rights years and has today become the main vehicle for the reproduction of racial hierarchies. Whatever the explanation, Loury argues, the uncontroversial fact is that changes in our criminal justice system since the 1970s have created a nether class of Americans&#x2015;vastly disproportionately black and brown&#x2015;with severely restricted rights and life chances. Moreover, conservatives and liberals agree that the growth in our prison population has long passed the point of diminishing returns. Stigmatizing and confining of a large segment of our population should be unacceptable to Americans. Loury's call to action makes all of us now responsible for ensuring that the policy changes. </p></p><p>Glenn C. Loury is the Merton P. Stoltz Professor of the Social Sciences in the Department of Economics at Brown University. A 2002 Carnegie Scholar, he is the author of <i>The Anatomy of Racial Inequality.</i><br><br>Pamela S. Karlan, Kenneth and Harle Montgomery Professor of Public Interest Law at Stanford Law School, cofounded the Stanford Law School Supreme Court Litigation Clinic, through which students litigate live cases before the U.S. Supreme Court.In this pithy discussion, renowned scholars debate the American penal system through the lens&#x2014;and as a legacy&#x2014;of an ugly and violent racial past. Economist Loury argues that incarceration rises even as crime rates fall because we have become increasingly punitive. According to Loury, the disproportionately black and brown prison populations are the victims of civil rights opponents who successfully moved the country's race dialogue to a seemingly race-neutral concern over crime. Loury's claims are well-supported with genuinely shocking statistics, and his argument is compelling that even if the racial argument about causes is inconclusive, the racial consequences are clear. Three shorter essays respond: Stanford law professor Karlan examines prisoners as an inert ballast in redistricting and voting practices; French sociologist Wacquant argues that the focus on race has ignored the fact that inmates are first and foremost <i>poor</i> people; and Harvard philosophy professor Shelby urges citizens to break with Washington's political outlook on race. The group's respectful sparring results in an insightful look at the conflicting theories of race and incarceration, and the slim volume keeps up the pace of the argument without being overwhelming. <i>(Sept.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Dr. Proudie, the newly appointed bishop, brings two powerful allies: Mrs. Proudie, the outspoken power behind the ecclesiastical throne, and a scheming chaplain, the odious Obadiah Slope. Anthony Trollope's novel satirizes Anglican Church infighting during the 1850s between "low church" reformers and "high church" conservatives. Trollope's ironic observations and keen social and psychological insights combine to form a tale with timeless appeal. <br>There are many ways to approache the prolific Victorian author's 47 novels, and <i>Barchester Towers</i> is among the best as an introduction. The success of its predecessor, <i>The Warden,</i> inspired Trollope to return to Barchester for the next in what ultimately became a series of six related novels. Rich in humor, wisdom, and memorable characters, this volume offers a captivating portrait of provincial life in 19th-century England.</p><p>This 1857 sequel to The Warden wryly chronicles the struggle for control of the English diocese of Barchester. The evangelical but not particularly competent new bishop is Dr. Proudie, who with his awful wife and oily curate, Slope, maneuver for power. <b>The Warden</b> and <b>Barchester Towers</b> are part of Trollope's Barsetshire series, in which some of the same characters recur.Founded in 1906 by J.M.

Each Everyman title offers these extensive materials at a price that competes with the most inexpensive editions on the market-but Everyman Paperbacks have durable binding, quality paper, and the highest editorial and scholarly standards.</p><h2>Los Alamos</h2><p>"I had this notion of what I called a democratic way of looking around, that nothing was more or less important," William Eggleston once said. This radical attitude guided his ground-breaking work in color photography, work that has prefigured many recent developments in art and photography. <i>Los Alamos</i> presents a series of photographs that has never before been shown, yet it contains a blueprint of Eggleston's aesthetics, his subtle use of subdued color hues, the casual elegance of his trenchant observations of the mysteries of the mundane. The photographs in Los Alamos were shot in Eggleston's native Memphis and on countless road trips across the American South from 1964 to 1968 and from 1972 to 1974. Initially, Eggleston wanted to create a vast compendium of more than 2000 photographs to be contained in 20 volumes; he wanted the viewer to look at the photographs the way one looks at the world. He eventually abandoned this project--and hardly any of the negatives were ever printed. Now, 30 years later, we finally get to see a selection of this encyclopedia of Southern everyday life and vernacular culture. It's a stunning discovery that makes the so-called snapshot photography of recent years pale in comparison. Eggleston's astonishingly timeless portraits, still lives, landscapes, and photographs of buildings add up to a profound investigation of the world and our way of looking at it, a poetics of pleasures hidden in full view. They transcend the merely descriptive and uncover the universal encapsulated in the details and the detritus of life in a consumer culture. Published in collaboration with Museum Ludwig, Cologne. <br> One of the few genuises in photography. --<i>Andy Grundberg</i><br>The world is so visually complicated that the word "banal" scarcely is very intelligent to use. All days are similar, no matter what part of this planet we're in. --<i>William Eggleston</i> <p>Essays by Walter Hopps and Thomas Weski. </p><p>Hardcover, 11.75 x 11 in., 224 pages, 97 color illustrations</p></p><p>William Eggleston was born in 1937 in Memphis, Tennessee. He took his first black-and-white photographs at age 18 and soon became serious about photography, though he never studied it formally. His first color work was shot in 1964 in color negative film, but in the late 60s he began to use color slides; it was some of those slides that he brought with him to New York in 1967, when he met Diane Arbus, Lee Friedlander, Garry Winogrand, and John Szarkowski. It was Szarkowski who curated Eggleston&#39;s landmark 1976 solo exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art, New York--a breakthrough in the perception of color photography as a serious form of fine art. The recipient of the 1998 Hasselblad Award, Eggleston&#39;s work was most recently seen in Documenta11 and in a major retrospective at the Fondation Cartier in Paris.The smell of gasoline and vinyl upholstery seems to saturate the pages of Eggleston&#x2019;s handsome new book, "Los Alamos" -- <i>The New York Times</i></p><h2>Everything and More: A Compact History of Infinity (Great Discoveries)</h2><p><p><strong>The best-selling author of <em>Infinite Jest</em> on the two-thousand-year-old quest to understand infinity.<br></strong></p> One of the outstanding voices of his generation, David Foster Wallace has won a large and devoted following for the intellectual ambition and bravura style of his fiction and essays. Now he brings his considerable talents to the history of one of math's most enduring puzzles: the seemingly paradoxical nature of infinity.<br><br> Is infinity a valid mathematical property or a meaningless abstraction? The nineteenth-century mathematical genius Georg Cantor's answer to this question not only surprised him but also shook the very foundations upon which math had been built. Cantor's counterintuitive discovery of a progression of larger and larger infinities created controversy in his time and may have hastened his mental breakdown, but it also helped lead to the development of set theory, analytic philosophy, and even computer technology.<br><br> Smart, challenging, and thoroughly rewarding, Wallace's tour de force brings immediate and high-profile recognition to the bizarre and fascinating world of higher mathematics.<br></p><p>Before discussing the merits of David Foster Wallace's <i>Everything and More: A Compact History of Infinity</i>, it is essential to define what the book is <i>not</i>. This volume in the "Great Discoveries" series is not a history of the personalities and social conditions that led to the "discovery" of infinity. Nor is it a narrative fixated on the cultish fear of--and obsession with--the infinite that has seemingly driven mathematicians insane over the centuries. Rather, <i>Everything and More</i> is a surprisingly rigorous march through the 2000 plus years of mathematical research that began with Aristotle; continued through Galileo, Isaac Newton, G.W. Leibniz, Karl Weierstrass, and J.W.R. Dedekind; and culminated in Georg Cantor and his Set Theory. The task Wallace (author of the bestseller <i>Infinite Jest</i> and other fiction) has set himself is enormously challenging: without radically compromising the complexity of the philosophy, metaphysics, or mathematics that underlies the evolving concept of infinity, present the material to a lay audience in a manner that is entertaining. To propel his narrative, Wallace even develops a style that mirrors the mathematical language he probes. One difficulty in his focus on concepts and not a strict human chronology, though, is that his structure is dependent on frequent digressions (especially early on). Patience is required. Wallace demands that his reader walk through the equations, study the graphs and charts, and relearn college-level concepts to follow along on the exploration. Indeed, after one wrenching dip into Zeno&#x2019;s paradoxes, Wallace spouts at his imagined complaining audience: "Deal." But the book should be deemed a success. If one grants him the attention he requires, Wallace has made the trip richly rewarding. <i>--Patrick O&#x2019;Kelley</i>David Foster Wallace (1962-2008) is the author of Infinite Jest, Girl with Curious Hair, Everything and More, The Broom of the System, and other fiction and nonfiction. Among his honors, he received a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship, a Lannan Literary Award, and a Whiting Writers&#39; Award.</p><h2>Dance Technique of Lester Horton</h2><p>A guide to the principles of dance and training developed by Lester Horton. It includes a foreword by Alvin Ailey, reminiscences of early Lester Horton technique by Bella Lewitzky, and a three-dimensional portrait of the life and work of Lester Horton by Jana Frances-Fischer.</p><p>Horton, a founder of modern dance in the United States, died young and is probably best known through his students Joyce Trisler, James Truitte, Bella Lewitzky, and others. Horton's vision of dance was generally ahead of its time. He had one of the first racially integrated companies, established the first theater devoted exclusively to dance, choreographed dances dealing with social issues, and formulated a dance technique that has trained and inspired many. Reminiscences by former students and an exceedingly brief biography introduce the heart of the book, the Horton vocabulary. The authors, themselves students and teachers of the technique, provide detailed descriptions of each movement, complete with illustrative drawings and photographs, counts and meters, explanatory notes, and recommended student levels. The specificity of the volume will make it enthusiastically welcomed by modern dance practitioners.

In this case someone with no criminal record, who would commit &#39;two simple murders&#39; for a very generous fee...</p><p>Connoisseur of art, harpsichord aficionado, gardener extraordinaire, and genius of improvisational murder, the inimitable Tom Ripley finds his complacency shaken when he is scorned at a posh gala. While an ordinary psychopath might repay the insult with some mild act of retribution, what Ripley has in mind is far more subtle, and infinitely more sinister. A social slight doesn&#39;t warrant murder of course-- just a chain of events that may lead to it.Patricia Highsmith was born in Fort Worth, Texas in 1921 but moved to New York when she was six. In her senior year she edited the college magazine, having decided to become a writer at the age of sixteen. Her first novel Strangers on a Train, was made into a famous film by Alfred Hitchcock in 1951. Patricia Highsmith died in Locarno, Switzerland in 1995. Her last novel Small g: A Summer Idyll was published posthumously just over a month later.</p><h2>Systematic Theology: Volume 3: The Doctrine of Salvation</h2><p>In the late 1800s, the president of Rochester Theological Seminary toiled away ceaselessly to complete a very important project. His intent was to provide his students and colleagues with comprehensive tools to rightly divide the word of truth (2 Timothy 2:15)... <p> But the finished work that materialized from his devoted study would go on to change the scholarly world forever. </p><p> By 1907, Augustus Hopkins Strong the same man who compiled the famously celebrated Strong s Concordance (1890), an obvious must-have for any serious student of the Bible emerged with a new, magnum opus masterpiece: Systematic Theology. </p><p> As the title reveals, its approach to developing a healthy understanding of foundational Christian doctrine requires placing scattered scriptural references on any one theological subject together in a single parent category, reflecting upon the original author s words in context to surrounding Scripture, and then thoroughly studying what those verses all have to say about a theological topic when combined. This practice of organizing biblical truths into categorical systems makes it impossible to casually and haphazardly take a verse out of context or to personally approach God with a weak, flimsy expectation of His order, design, and character which is why researchers, students, scholars, and lay believers all over the world have relied heavily upon Strong s work since the day it went to print. </p><p> Strong s Systematic Theology is so exhaustive and thorough that, from the beginning, it required being subdivided into three major volumes: The Doctrine of God, The Doctrine of Man, and The Doctrine of Salvation. </p><p> Defender Publishing is proud to republish this extraordinary 3-Volume masterpiece as a resource and study tool for scholars and all students of the Bible, that their lives and faith may be thoroughly equipped for every good work (2 Tim. 3:17).</p></p><p></p><h2>The City of God and the Goal of Creation (Short Studies in Biblical Theology)</h2><p><p><strong>&#x201c;For here we have no lasting city, but we seek the city that is to come.&#x201d; &#x2013;Hebrews 13:14</strong></p><p>At the very heart of God&#x2019;s plan for the world stands an extraordinary city.

Devoney Looser's <i>The Making of Jane Austen</i> turns to the people, performances, activism, and images that fostered Austen's early fame, laying the groundwork for the beloved author we think we know. </p><p>Here are the Austen influencers, including her first English illustrator, the eccentric Ferdinand Pickering, whose sensational gothic images may be better understood through his brushes with bullying, bigamy, and an attempted matricide. The daring director-actress Rosina Filippi shaped Austen's reputation with her pioneering dramatizations, leading thousands of young women to ventriloquize Elizabeth Bennet's audacious lines before drawing room audiences. Even the supposedly staid history of Austen scholarship has its bizarre stories. The author of the first Jane Austen dissertation, student George Pellew, tragically died young, but he was believed by many, including his professor-mentor, to have come back from the dead.</p><p>Looser shows how these figures and their Austen-inspired work transformed Austen's reputation, just as she profoundly shaped theirs. Through them, Looser describes the factors and influences that radically altered Austen's evolving image. Drawing from unexplored material, Looser examines how echoes of that work reverberate in our explanations of Austen's literary and cultural power. Whether you're a devoted Janeite or simply Jane-curious, <i>The Making of Jane Austen</i> will have you thinking about how a literary icon is made, transformed, and handed down from generation to generation.</p></p><p><p>An engaging account of how Jane Austen became a household name.</p><p>Whether you're a devoted Janeite or simply Jane-curious, <i>The Making of Jane Austen</i> will have you thinking about how a literary icon is made, transformed, and handed down from generation to generation.</p><p>"Energetic and revealing."&#x2015;Jane Smiley, <i>New York Times Book Review</i></p><p>"Timely and authoritative."&#x2015;<i>Times Literary Supplement</i></p><p>"Austen fans have another book to add to their libraries."&#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><p>"A studious and sensible book, driven by a commitment to shedding light on Austen's work and context."&#x2015;<i>Times Higher Education</i></p><p>"<i>The Making of Jane Austen</i> lovingly unveils Austen's posthumous journey to become a permanent fixture in classic English literature."&#x2015;<i>Foreword Reviews</i></p><p>"An informative and delightful read for literary lovers who want to learn more about one of the most celebrated authors of all time, <i>The Making of Jane Austen</i> puts the famed novelist in a whole new light."&#x2015;<i>Bustle</i></p><p>"Written with wit and in pleasing yet learned prose, the book bridges well the gap between academic and popular writing."&#x2015;<i>Choice</i></p><p>"<i>The Making of Jane Austen</i> is both an essential, rigorously researched text for serious Austen scholars and an irresistibly lively reading experience for even the most newly initiated of Janeites."&#x2015;<i>Romantic Circles</i></p><p>"The story of how Jane Austen became, in Looser's words, 'Jane!

When her most famous story, <em>The Awakening</em>, was first published in 1899, it stunned readers with its frank portrayal of the inner word of Edna Pontellier, and its daring criticisms of the limits of marriage and motherhood. The subtle beauty of her writing was contrasted with her unwomanly and sordid subject-matter: Edna's rejection of her domestic role, and her passionate quest for spiritual, sexual, and artistic freedom. From her first stories, Chopin was interested in independent characters who challenged convention. This selection, freshly edited from the first printing of each text, enables readers to follow her unfolding career as she experimented with a broad range of writing, from tales for children to decadent <em>fin-de</em> <em>siecle</em> sketches. <em>The Awakening</em> is set alongside thirty-two short stories, illustrating the spectrum of the fiction from her first published stories to her 1898 secret masterpiece, "The Storm."<br><br><strong>About the Series:</strong> For over 100 years <strong>Oxford World's Classics</strong> has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe.

Now widely read and admired, <i>The Awakening</i> has been hailed as an early vision of woman's emancipation. This sensuous book tells of a woman's abandonment of her family, her seduction, and her awakening to desires and passions that threated to consumer her. Originally entitled "A Solitary Soul," this portrait of twenty-eight-year-old Edna Pontellier is a landmark in American fiction, rooted firmly in the romantic tradition of Herman Melville and Emily Dickinson. Here, a woman in search of self-discovery turns away from convention and society, and toward the primal, from convention and society, and toward the primal, irresistibly attracted to nature and the senses<i>The Awakening</i>, Kate Chopin's last novel, has been praised by Edmund Wilson as "beautifully written." And Willa Cather described its style as "exquisite," "sensitive," and "iridescent." This edition of <i>The Awakening</i> also includes a selection of short stories by Kate Chopin. <p>"This seems to me a higher order of feminism than repeating the story of woman as victim... Kate Chopin gives her female protagonist the central role, normally reserved for Man, in a meditation on identity and culture, consciousness and art." -- From the introduction by Marilynne Robinson.</p>"A Creole Bovary is this little novel of Miss Chopin's."<br>--Willa Cather</p><h2>Religion and the Decline of Magic: Studies in popular beliefs in sixteenth and seventeenth century England</h2><p>Astrology, witchcraft, magical healing, divination, ancient prophecies, ghosts, and fairies were taken very seriously by people at all social and economic levels in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century England. Helplessness in the face of disease and human disaster helped to perpetuate this belief in magic and the supernatural. As Keith Thomas shows, England during these years resembled in many ways today's "underdeveloped areas." The English population was exceedingly liable to pain, sickness, and premature death; many were illiterate; epidemics such as the bubonic plague plowed through English towns, at times cutting the number of London's inhabitants by a sixth; fire was a constant threat; the food supply was precarious; and for most diseases there was no effective medical remedy. <br> In this fascinating and detailed book, Keith Thomas shows how magic, like the medieval Church, offered an explanation for misfortune and a means of redress in times of adversity. The supernatural thus had its own practical utility in daily life. Some forms of magic were challenged by the Protestant Reformation, but only with the increased search for scientific explanation of the universe did the English people begin to abandon their recourse to the supernatural. <br> Science and technology have made us less vulnerable to some of the hazards which confronted the people of the past. Yet <em>Religion and the Decline of Magic</em> concludes that "if magic is defined as the employment of ineffective techniques to allay anxiety when effective ones are not available, then we must recognize that no society will ever be free from it."</p><p><br><strong>Sir Keith Thomas</strong> is President of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, and President of the British Academy. His works include <em>Man and the Natural World</em>, and other writings on the social and cultural history of early modern England.

Nine different tales range from the realism of L�pez Portillo's &#x201c;Reloj sin due�o&#x201d; and the modernismo saturating Guti�rrez N�jera's "La ma�ana de San Juan" to the historical accuracy of Riva Palacio's "Las mulas de Su Excelencia" and the vivid romanticism of "Amor secreto" by Manuel Payno, named the "father of Mexican short stories." <br>Each story appears in its original Spanish text with expert English translations on each facing page.

Though on the surface it explores religious faith--the intellectually committed as well as the passionately observant--the struggles addressed in <i>The Chosen</i> are familiar to families of all faiths and in all nations. <p> In 1940s Brooklyn, New York, an accident throws Reuven Malther and Danny Saunders together. Despite their differences (Reuven is a Modern Orthodox Jew with an intellectual, Zionist father; Danny is the brilliant son and rightful heir to a Hasidic rebbe), the young men form a deep, if unlikely, friendship. Together they negotiate adolescence, family conflicts, the crisis of faith engendered when Holocaust stories begin to emerge in the U.S., loss, love, and the journey to adulthood. The intellectual and spiritual clashes between fathers, between each son and his own father, and between the two young men, provide a unique backdrop for this exploration of fathers, sons, faith, loyalty, and, ultimately, the power of love. (This is not a conventional children's book, although it will move any wise child age 12 or older, and often appears on summer reading lists for high school students.)</p>6 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Meeting Faith: The Forest Journals of a Black Buddhist Nun</h2><p><p><strong>A wry account of the road from Harvard scholarship student to ordination as northern Thailand's first black Buddhist nun.</strong></p> Reluctantly leaving behind Pop Tarts and pop culture to battle flying rats, hissing cobras, forest fires, and decomposing corpses, Faith Adiele shows readers in this personal narrative, with accompanying journal entries, that the path to faith is full of conflicts for even the most devout. Residing in a forest temple, she endured nineteen-hour daily meditations, living on a single daily meal, and days without speaking. Internally Adiele battled against loneliness, fear, hunger, sexual desire, resistance to the Buddhist worldview, and her own rebellious Western ego. Adiele demystifies Eastern philosophy and demonstrates the value of developing any practice&#x2015;Buddhist or not. This "unlikely, bedraggled nun" moves grudgingly into faith, learning to meditate for seventy-two hours at a stretch. Her witty, defiant twist on the standard coming-of-age tale suggests that we each hold the key to overcoming anger, fear, and addiction; accepting family; redefining success; and re-creating community and quality of life in today's world. 10 illustrations.</p><p>Faith Adiele, a graduate of Harvard College and the Iowa Writers&#39; Workshop, is assistant professor of English at the University of Pittsburgh. She lives in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.Jan Willis meets Anne Lamott in this funny, observant memoir by Adiele, an English professor at the University of Pittsburgh. Burned out by the pressure of undergraduate studies at Harvard, Adiele took a year off to get her head together and do field research in Thailand, where she had once spent time as a Rotary exchange student. She became fascinated with Buddhist nuns and began soliciting their stories, a process that led to her rather impulsive decision to seek "temporary ordination" as a nun herself. The nominal-Unitarian-turned-Buddhist is humble about her spiritual insights: "Where I should be �ber-nun, I'm not even what is perceived as a practicing Buddhist. I don't meditate regularly; I nurse anger; I despise tofu. Dammit, I don't appear to have learned anything! So how can anyone learn from me?" But readers can and will learn from Adiele, who parses out her second stay in Thailand with a comic's timing, a novelist's keen observations about human idiosyncrasies and an anthropologist's sensitivity to issues of race and culture. Her main narrative is almost talmudically surrounded by commentary: all along the outer margins of the book, quotes from Buddhist luminaries mingle with excerpts from her own very raw journals from that year. As she admits her fear of the rats that infested her meditation cave or chronicles her pride in gradually increasing her meditation hours, we are privileged to see an unvarnished vulnerability. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Passive investing is all about earning your fair share of financial market returns whether the market is US stocks, international stocks, bonds, commodities, or any combination of those investments. <br><br> The opposite of passive investing is active investing. This is the act of trying to beat the markets by using an infinite number of higher-cost strategies that probably won&#x2019;t work. Nobel Laureates in Economics have been telling us for decades that passive investing is a better investment strategy than active investing. <i>The Power of Passive Investing </i>brings many of those studies together in one book. <br><br> <b>How is this book different from your previous ones, such as <i>The ETF Book</i>, <i>All About Asset Allocation</i>, and <i>All About Index Funds</i>? </b><br> My previous books explain how to select low-cost index funds and ETFs, and how to create a portfolio using these funds. <i>The Power of Passive Investing</i> provides the proof about why this is a superior strategy to trying to beat the markets. The evidence in the book is irrefutable. <br><br> <b>Who is the target audience of this book? </b><br> <i>The Power of Passive Investing</i> is written for any investor who wants to understand more about the mutual funds they are investing in, including people who have a 401(k) or similar work savings plan. It&#x2019;s also an important book for brokers and consultants who make a living recommending mutual funds and ETFs, as well as banks, trust departments and investment advisors who manage other people&#x2019;s money. Finally, it&#x2019;s a particularly important book for people who oversee endowments, foundations, and pension funds. <br><br> <b>An observation you make is that while it&#x2019;s possible to beat the market, it&#x2019;s not probable. What are the odds a mutual fund will beat the market? </b><br> Mutual fund companies that try to beat the market argue that it&#x2019;s possible to do so. They are right. It is possible; it&#x2019;s just not probable, and the payout stinks. <br><br> Active managers often point to Warren Buffett, the famous CEO of Berkshire Hathaway as an example. They imply that since Warren beats the markets that we should believe that they, too, will win. That&#x2019;s nonsense. Here are three reasons why it can&#x2019;t be true: <ul> <li></li>About one-third of mutual funds go out of business every 10 years, and about 50 percent are defunct after 20 years. <li></li>Only about 1 in 3 of the surviving funds outperform index funds. Surviving funds are the ones that don&#x2019;t close, and it assumes you know which ones those will be, which is not possible. <li></li>The excess return from the winning surviving funds doesn&#x2019;t come close to the shortfall from the losing funds, and this is before accounting for the losses in the defunct funds before they closed. </ul> <b>The Power of Passive Investing explains the near certainty that a portfolio of index funds will beat a portfolio of active funds over time. Tell me about this conclusion. </b><br> We&#x2019;ve addressed one mutual fund versus one index and the low probability for active fund success. But that&#x2019;s doesn&#x2019;t define the whole problem because people don&#x2019;t own just one mutual fund. They own several funds across diversified asset classes such as US stock, international stock, bonds, real estate, and so forth. <br><br> Having several active funds in a portfolio exponentially lowers the probability that the portfolio will beat a comparable index fund portfolio. As more active funds are added, and the longer their held, the probability that a portfolio of index funds will outperform the active fund portfolio increases dramatically to the point where the index funds have a 99 percent probability of outperforming a comparable portfolio of active funds. Now that&#x2019;s something that all investors should consider! <br><br> <b>Why do active investing strategies fail to beat the market for the vast majority of investors? </b><br> There are several reasons that active funds fail to deliver, not the least is the cost of trying to beat the markets. Hundreds of thousands of investment managers, investment advisors, brokers, mutual funds manager, pension funds managers, banks, trust departments, individual investors, traders, etc., are attempting to out-fox the markets. They spend hundreds of billions of dollars each year trading securities, paying managers and consultants, buying research, etc. The cost of trying to beat the market makes doing so impossible for most people. <br><br> A second reason investors fail to beat the market is due to poor behavior. They seek high returns by looking in the wrong places for outperformance. Active investors chase after past performance, they chase star ratings, and they chase the news. They&#x2019;re putting money in places today where they should have already had money. This tail chasing game costs investors dearly. <br><br> <b>You make the case for low-cost index funds. But mutual fund fees aren&#x2019;t the only cost. What other costs do investors bear? </b> <br> There are trading costs, commissions, advisor fees, taxes, 12b-1 fees, administrative costs, research costs and the list goes on. Much of these costs are hidden from investors. For example, most investors in 401(k) plans don&#x2019;t provide investors good transparency on the costs they&#x2019;re paying. <br><br> Another bastion of gluttony is high advisor fees. This issue is just starting to come out in the media. The typical investment advisor charges one percent per year to manage a portfolio of mutual funds for clients. That&#x2019;s crazy-high given the huge advances in portfolio management software and other technology that have occurred over the years. Advisors today should be able to handle five times the amount of clients with half the amount of staff than they did in the 1990s. These productivity gains have not been passed on to clients in the form of lower fees. <br><br> <b>What should investment advisers charge their clients? </b><br> Well, it&#x2019;s not one percent, which is the &#x2018;standard fee&#x2019; you&#x2019;ll hear in the marketplace. I believe Investors shouldn&#x2019;t pay more than 0.5 percent per year to an advisor, and probably less. My firm, Portfolio Solutions, charges only 0.25 percent in annual fees. We&#x2019;ve been charging this low fee for more than a decade, and it has saved our clients millions of dollars over the years. That&#x2019;s real money is in their pockets. <br><br> <b>Why do so many people try to beat the market if the proof that passive investing outperforms active investing is irrefutable? </b><br> There&#x2019;s big advertising dollars promoting active management - much more than passive managers can afford. Remember, actively managed funds charge 5 to 10 times the fee of a comparable index fund. Much of this huge revenue stream is spent bombarding the public with nonsense about how active mangers can beat the market, and it basically ensures that the truth about passive investing gets lost in the noise. <br><br> Did you know that for every new book published on passive investing there are at least a dozen books published on how you can beat the market? Did you know that for every media interview with a passive investing advocate like myself there are at least 100 interviews with people who claim they can beat the market? <br><br> It&#x2019;s actually amazing to me that any information about passive investing gets to the public, and it&#x2019;s a credit to investors who have looked beyond the smoke and mirrors. <br><br> <b>How can someone adopt a passive investment strategy? What&#x2019;s the first step? </b><br> The answer is to start learning the real facts about the markets and investing. You can start with <i>The Power of Passive Investing</i> if you&#x2019;re already knowledgeable about mutual fund investing. I&#x2019;ve also written several how-to books on low-cost index fund investing, exchange-traded funds, asset allocation and planning for retirement. <br><br></p><p><p>Investing is serious business and mistakes cost money. Whether you're acting for yourself or as a fiduciary for others, your aim should always be to reduce mistakes and increase the probability that the portfolio you're responsible for succeeds in achieving its objective.</p> <p>Nobody understands this better than author Richard Ferri, an investment expert and founder of the advisory firm Portfolio Solutions(R). Now, in The Power of Passive Investing, he reveals how this proven strategy can effectively put your portfolio in a better position to gain its fair share of market returns. This approach is done with a strong understanding and commitment to low-cost, passively managed index funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs)--which, today, span almost every asset class and style, including U.S. and foreign equity funds, bond funds, commodities funds, and even currencies.</p> <p>Filled with in-depth insights and expert advice, this reliable resource offers practical guidance on creating a sound, long-term investment plan--within a framework of controlled risk--and helps clarify and quantify the purpose of investing along the way. Containing dozens of historical studies covering several decades and financial markets, it will clearly show you how passive investors who buy the market will capture better results than most active investors who try to beat the market.</p> <p>Divided into three comprehensive parts, The Power of Passive Investing: </p> <ul> <li> <p>Tracks the passive versus active debate from its beginnings early in the twentieth century to today and explores the advantages of investing in individual index funds and ETFs over individual actively managed funds</p> </li> <li> <p>Focuses on portfolio decisions and investor behavior and looks at some of the reasons more people haven't put the power of passive investing to use yet</p> </li> <li> <p>Discusses the purpose of investment policy and makes the case for passive investing in terms of four different groups: individual investors and their families; trustees of charities and private accounts; pension trustees and those who select investment options for employer-sponsored pension plans; and professional investment advisors</p> </li> </ul> <p>Attempting to earn above-market returns with a portfolio of actively managed funds is both a waste of time and money. A well-designed, passive investment approach that utilizes index funds and ETFs has the highest probability of meeting your financial goals and is the most prudent choice for your money. The Power of Passive Investing will show you why this is true as well as how this approach can work for you.</p>"Rick Ferri has done investors a great favor by collecting in one place the consistently overwhelming evidence that index funds keep beating active funds. The only remaining problem for 'passive' investing is the name. Why don't we all agree on a single change and call indexing success investing?"<br> &#x2015;CHARLES D. ELLIS, bestselling author of Winning the Loser's Game and The Elements of Investing <p>"Indexing wins because indexing must win. The best index funds win simply because they eliminate management fees and sales loads, and minimize operating costs and portfolio turnover and its costs. But Ferri takes us from theory to reality, providing scores of examples and tabulations that prove that very point. I commend it to you."<br> &#x2015;JOHN C.

As a complete and high-level programming language in itself, it's been a favorite since it was developed in the mid 1980s by David G. Korn at AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories. Knowing how to use it is an essential skill for serious Unix users. <i>Learning the Korn Shell</i> shows you how to use the Korn shell as a user interface and as a programming environment.Writing applications is often easier and quicker with Korn than with other high-level languages. Because of this, the Korn shell is the most often used shell in commercial environments and among inexperienced users. There are two other widely used shells, the Bourne shell and the C shell. The Korn shell, or <i>ksh</i>, has the best features of both, plus many new features of its own. <i>ksh</i> can do much to enhance productivity and the quality of a user's work, both in interacting with the system, and in programming. The new version, <i>ksh93</i>, has the functionality of other scripting languages such as awk, icon, Perl, rexx, and tcl.<i>Learning the Korn Shell</i> is the key to gaining control of the Korn shell and becoming adept at using it as an interactive command and scripting language. Prior programming experience is not required in order to understand the chapters on basic shell programming. Readers will learn how to write many applications more easily and quickly than with other high-level languages. In addition, readers will also learn about Unix utilities and the way the Unix operating system works in general. The authors maintain that you shouldn't have to be an internals expert to use and program the shell effectively.The second edition covers all the features of the current version of the Korn shell, including many new features not in earlier versions of ksh93, making it the most up-to-date reference available on the Korn shell. It compares the current version of the Korn shell to several other Bourne-compatible shells, including several Unix emulation environments for MS-DOS and Windows. In addition, it describes how to download and build ksh93 from source code.A solid offering for many years, this newly revised title inherits a long tradition of trust among computer professionals who want to learn or refine an essential skill.</p></p><p>This Nutshell Handbook(R) is a thorough introduction to the Korn shell, both as a user interface and as a programming language. The Korn shell, like the C and Bourne shells, is a program that interprets UNIX commands. It has many features that aren&#39;t found in other shells, including command history (the ability to recall and edit previous commands). The Korn shell is also faster; several of its features allow you to write programs that execute more quickly than their Bourne or C shell equivalents. This book provides a clear and concise explanation of the Korn shell&#39;s features. It explains ksh string operations, co-processes, signals and signal handling, and one of the worst &#34;dark corners&#34; of shell programming: command-line interpretation. It does this by introducing simple real-life examples and then adding options and complexity in later chapters, illustrating the way real-world script development generally proceeds. An additional (and unique) programming aid, a Korn shell debugger (kshdb), is also included. Learning the Korn Shell is an ideal resource for many UNIX users and programmers, including software developers who want to &#34;prototype&#34; their designs, system administrators who want to write tools for their own use, and even novices who just want to use some of ksh&#39;s more advanced interactive features.<p>Arnold Robbins, an Atlanta native, is a professional programmer and technical author.

In <em>Grimoires: A History of Magic Books</em>, Owen Davies illuminates the many fascinating forms these recondite books have taken and exactly what these books held. At their most benign, these repositories of forbidden knowledge revealed how to make powerful talismans and protective amulets, and provided charms and conjurations for healing illness, finding love, and warding off evil. But other books promised the power to control innocent victims, even to call up the devil. Davies traces the history of this remarkably resilient and adaptable genre, from the ancient Middle East to modern America, offering a new perspective on the fundamental developments of western civilization over the past two thousand years. <em>Grimoires</em> shows the influence magic and magical writing has had on the cultures of the world, richly demonstrating the role they have played in the spread of Christianity, the growth of literacy, and the influence of western traditions from colonial times to the present.</p><p><br><strong>Owen Davies</strong> is Reader in Social History at the University of Hertfordshire.

It was a trip that began as a pure and (many said) lunatic gesture of independence and quickly turned into an all-out battle of wits against the forces of both nature and civilization. Cocky and outspoken, Robyn Davidson's tale is at once the probing journal of a daring and stubborn woman and a wilderness adventure of the most exhilarating sort. Rick Smolan, the photographer, had his own adventure tracking Robyn down to document her trip for <b>National Geographic</b> magazine. The outback of Australia, seen through Rick's cameras and Robyn's words, is an ancient awesome landscape swept by rain, heat and dust and inhabited by all varieties of marauding life, from poisonous snakes and wild bull camels to swarms of tourists clamoring after their newest heroine, the "Camel Lady." When Robyn and her caravan reach their destination six months and 1700 miles of outback later, their arrival marks the end of a true odyssey and an unforgettable book.In April 1977, Robyn Davidson set out with four camels and a dog to cross the deserts of Western Australia--1700 miles from Alice Springs to the Indian Ocean. Her sponsor, National Geographic , arranged for photographer Rick Smolan to meet her at various locations along the way. Davidson's riveting account of her journey, Tracks, won awards and became a bestseller. Here, Smolan presents his color photographs alongside excerpts from Tracks. It is a rewarding combination that dramatizes the hardships Davidson encountered and the stark beauty of a hostile landscape. Smolen, creator of the Day in the Life series, photographed tourists, aborigines, scenery and Davidson with her animals--riding, resting, playing. His images make a great adventure even more memorable. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Imperial Nature: The World Bank and Struggles for Social Justice in the Age of Globalization (Yale Agrarian Studies Series)</h2><p><p><b>A piercing, first-hand analysis of&nbsp;the World Bank, one of&nbsp;the most powerful actors in today's global economy.</b><br><br> Why is the World Bank so successful? How has it gained power even at moments in history when it seemed likely to fall? This pathbreaking book is the first close examination of the inner workings of the Bank, the foundations of its achievements, its propensity for intensifying the problems it intends to cure, and its remarkable ability to tame criticism and extend its own reach.</p><p><br> Michael Goldman takes us inside World Bank headquarters in Washington, D.C., and then to Bank project sites around the globe. He explains how projects funded by the Bank really work and why community activists struggle against the World Bank and its brand of development. Goldman looks at recent ventures in areas such as the environment, human rights, and good governance and reveals how&#x2014;despite its poor track record&#x2014;the World Bank has acquired greater authority and global power than ever before.</p><p><br> The book sheds new light on the World Bank&#x2019;s role in increasing global inequalities and considers why it has become the central target for anti-globalization movements worldwide. For anyone concerned about globalization and social justice, <i>Imperial Nature </i>is<i></i>essential reading.</p></p><p><b>Michael Goldman</b> is associate professor of sociology at the University of Minnesota and is affiliated with its Institute for Global Studies.This probing study of the World Bank examines not its brute financial muscle but its "hegemony"-the rhetorical strategies, training programs and patronage networks that let the Bank frame debate and cajole even critics into endorsing its agenda. Sociologist Goldman focuses on what he calls the Bank's "green neoliberalism," a fashionable development ideology that packages poor nations' public services, natural resources and environmental diversity as undervalued economic assets to be profitably managed and conserved through the market. He explores this creed through interviews with Bank employees and onsite studies of Bank-financed projects, looking at the Bank's Policy Research Department, a project in Laos that links construction of hydroelectric dams with the set-aside of nature preserves, and an ambitious initiative to privatize water utilities. Goldman levels a biting but nuanced account of the Bank's dubious scientific studies, its cooptation of environmentalists and the "neocolonialism" of its new enthusiasm for pristine eco-tourism zones that are often as disruptive to traditional communities as old-style development. Unfortunately, he overlays it with a great deal of dense theory, heavily indebted to Gramsci and Foucault, about "power/knowledge regimes," adding little insight but lots of jargon. That's a shame, since this clumsy rhetorical strategy partly obscures an excellent critique of the Bank's inner workings and external image-making.

Through the use of such "folk" concepts as belief, desire, intention, and expectation, asserts Daniel Dennett in this first full-scale presentation of a theory of intentionality that he has been developing for almost twenty years. We adopt a stance, he argues, a predictive strategy of interpretation that presupposes the rationality of the people - or other entities - we are hoping to understand and predict.<br> <br> These principles of radical interpretation have far-reaching implications for the metaphysical and scientific status of the processes referred to by the everday terms of folk psychology and their corresponding terms in cognitive science.<br> <br> While Dennett's philosophical stance has been steadfast over the years, his views have undergone successive enrichments, refinements, and extensions. <i>The Intentional Stance</i> brings together both previously published and original material: four of the book's ten chapters - its first and the final three - appear here for the first time and push the theory into surprising new territory. The remaining six were published earlier in the 1980s but were not easily accessible; each is followed by a reflection - an essay reconsidering and extending the claims of the earlier work. These reflections and the new chapters represent the vanguard of Dennett's thought. They reveal fresh lines of inquiry into fundamental issues in psychology, artificial intelligence, and evolutionary theory as well as traditional issues in the philosophy of mind.<br> <br> Daniel C. Dennett is Distinguished Arts and Sciences Professor at Tufts University and the author of <i>Brainstorms</i> and <i>Elbow Room</i>. <i>The Intentional Stance</i>, along with these works, is a Bradford Book.</p><p>How are we able to understand each other in our daily interactions?

The Christian church, in general, struggles to address issues of sexuality in a non-shaming way, which further supports the hidden nature of the addiction. For these men and women, spirituality and sexuality have become compartmentalized. Recovery, then, must involve the integration of healthy spiritual beliefs and practices with healthy sexuality. <i>Shadows of the Cross</i> used in conjunction with Dr. Patrick Carnes's book <i>Facing the Shadow</i> will provide a roadmap for this healing journey.</p><p><i>Shadows of the Cross</i> provides an early spiritual focus to recovery while addressing issues of sexuality in a non-shaming way using Biblical scripture to encourage long-term recovery.<i> Shadows of the Cross</i> offers unique guidance on spiritual practices such as Christian meditation, contemplative reading, solitude, confession, study, and prayer. This book was written specifically for the subset of those in recovery who self-identify as Christian.</p><p><b>Craig S.

A century ago there was an enormous demand for bird feathers to be used in trimming women&#39;s hats and bonnets. Feathers were, in effect, symbols of rank and station in western culture. Some bird species became regionally extinct and many others were endangered. Then came a movement in the United States and Great Britain for the conservation of non-game birds. .

These novels, written in the period of Bellow&#x2019;s greatest literary and popular acclaim&#x2014;he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1976&#x2014;are unsparing yet humane, and range widely in their philosophical and cultural concerns. They offer the indispensable voice of a great American raconteur and thinker.<br><br>In&nbsp;<i>Mr. Sammler&#x2019;s Planet</i>, the anarchic forces of late-1960s America are set loose on Artur Sammler, a highly cultured septuagenarian and European �migr� who seeks &#x201c;with God, to be free from the bondage of the ordinary and the finite.&#x201d; A Holocaust survivor living out his latter days in Manhattan, Sammler endures the city&#x2019;s everyday barbarism, as shocking as it is casual, and must contend with absurd complications when a manuscript goes missing.<br><br><i>Humboldt&#x2019;s Gift</i>&nbsp;depicts the deep and troubled friendship between the tormented poet Von Humboldt Fleisher and the renowned writer Charlie Citrine. Humboldt has died in squalid obscurity, but for Citrine the memory of their earlier days persists as counterpoint to a middle age studded with difficulties: a messy divorce, a demanding mistress, and the attentions of a Chicago hoodlum who claims that Charlie has cheated him. Writing of the book&#x2019;s &#x201c;rich and suggestive&#x201d; narrative voice, Sven Birkerts observes, &#x201c;There is a feeling when reading this novel that a tightly rolled sultan&#x2019;s carpet has splashed open before our eyes.&#x201d;<br><br>In&nbsp;<i>The Dean&#x2019;s December</i>, Albert Corde experiences totalitarianism firsthand when he travels to Bucharest to visit his dying mother-in-law. As a college dean in Chicago he has attracted controversy through his journalism and his role in a racially charged murder trial. Alternating between Romanian and American settings, the novel is a profound indictment of official hypocrisy and corruption on both sides of the Iron Curtain.<br><br><b>LIBRARY OF AMERICA</b>&nbsp;is an independent nonprofit cultural organization founded in 1979 to preserve our nation&#x2019;s literary heritage by publishing, and keeping permanently in print, America&#x2019;s best and most significant writing.

He lives in Archer City, Texas.<b>Chapter 1</b><br>Patsy sat by herself at the beginning of the evening, eating a melted Hershey bar. She had been reading <i>Catch-22</i> but remembered the Hershey and fished it out of the glove compartment, where it had been all day. It was too melted to be neatly handleable, so she laid the paperback on the car seat and avidly swiped the chocolate off the candy paper with two fingers. When the candy was gone, she dropped the sticky wrappers out the window and licked what was left of the chocolate off her fingers before picking up the book again.<br>Sometimes she ate casually and read avidly -- other times she read casually and ate avidly. Another melted Hershey would have left her content, but there wasn't another. The glove compartment held nothing but road maps and a bottle of hand lotion, and if she walked to a concession stand and bought another Hershey it wouldn't be melted, probably.<br>And it was dusk, almost too dark to read. She had been in the grandstand, but the lights around the arena had come on too early, spoiling some of the softness of the evening, so she had come back to the Ford. Evening had always been her favorite time of day, and in Texas, in the spring, it was especially so. Dawn was said to be just as lovely, but she had seen only a few dawns and had been only half awake at most of those. It was evening that made her feel keen and fresh and hopeful.<br>The Ford was parked far back from the arena in a jumble of pickups and horsetrailers, far enough away that the lights and noise of rodeo scarcely intruded on the dusk. Soon she put <i>Catch-22</i> on the seat again and sat watching the sky to the west. The sun had gone down and all the lower sky was yellow. While she watched, it became orange and then red and then a fainter red, and the color lingered on the rim of the plains until the whole sky was dark.<br>She wore a gray dress and was bare-armed. It had been a hot afternoon for May, and the coolness of dusk felt good on her arms. Behind her, at the near end of the bleachers, a high school band broke into the National Anthem -- it meant that the Grand Entry was in progress. The arena was full of horses and riders: rodeo had come again to Merkel, Texas. There were riding clubs, kids piled on ponies, pivot men unfurling the flags of the nations, cowgirls in tight pink trousers, and nervous businessmen on palominos. The procession into the arena had been very noisy, but before the anthem ended, the sound of hoofs and the jingling of bits faded out and the grounds became so quiet that Patsy heard it when one of the young clarinetists squeaked his reed. Everyone but her was standing up and the knowledge made her fretful and a little ashamed of herself.<br>The sport of rodeo did not interest Patsy at all -- it interested her husband Jim. She herself had lumped it in her mind with cows, and cows did not interest her at all -- not, at least, unless they were properly cooked. The fact that no cows were at hand was merely a lucky happenstance; in that part of Texas cows might appear at any moment. The only animal immediately at hand was a fat sorrel horse. He was tied to the sideboards of a nearby trailer, close enough that Patsy could smell him. Aside from one fart, he had been very polite and had gained her sympathies. Several times cowboys had walked by and slapped him on the behind to make him move over, and he had refrained from kicking them. If similarly provoked, she felt sure she would have kicked them. Occasionally the horse swished his tail against the fender of the Ford.<br>In the west a few very bright stars were out, though it was still not completely dark. She felt a little restless and was considering what she might do, when another cowboy walked by, a can of beer in one hand. He slapped the horse on the rump and the horse moved over. The cowboy burped, pitched down his beer can, unbuttoned his pants, and immediately began to relieve himself against the fender of the Ford.<br>"Hey," Patsy said, very startled. "Go piss on your own car!"<br>She was too surprised to sound very outraged, but she was no more surprised than the cowboy. He whirled around toward the trailer, liberally watering the whole area, horse included.<br>"My god, I never knowed you was there," he said. "Why didn't you speak up sooner?"<br>"Shock prevented me," she said faintly, for she <i>was</i> shocked -- the more so as the first surprise wore off. She could hear him pissing.<br>"Lady," he sighed, "I would stop. I just ain't got the brakes."<br>"Oh, hell," she said, flustered.<br>The cowboy was silent until he finished and had buttoned up. He stood with his back to her a moment, apparently in thought, and then confidently hitched up his pants and turned toward the car.<br>"Ed Boggs," he said. "I guess I ought to apologize."<br>"I'm Patsy Carpenter," Patsy said, assuming that an introduction was taking place. Ed Boggs was clearly charmed. He leaned his elbows on the car door and peered in at her happily. His face was paunchy and he smelled of beer and starch and hair oil.<br>"Never meant to mess up your fender," he said, not bothering to affect remorse. "I just kinda needed somethin' to lean on there for a minute. Been puttin' 'em down a little too fast this evenin'. What I really want to do is ask you for a date to the dance. You look to me like you've got a lot on the ball."<br>"Why, thanks," Patsy said, smiling. Her cheeks colored. She could never help smiling when complimented. "I'm married, though."<br>Mr. Boggs neither moved nor changed expression, and she assumed he had not understood.<br>"I can't go to the dance with you, I mean. I'm really married."<br>Ed Boggs was in no way discouraged. "Who ain't?" he said amiably. "My old lady's married too. How about me gettin' in and sittin' down with you a minute to catch my breath?"<br>Patsy wanted very much to scoot toward the opposite door. Sitting beneath Mr. Boggs's face was like sitting beneath a heavy, badly balanced wooden object. He reached for the door handle, as if he were sure she wouldn't mind his getting in, but Patsy had locked the door and he didn't quite have the nerve to unlock it.<br>"No, you can't get in," she said. "You're being a little rude. I was about to take a nap. Why don't you go off and fill your bladder again?"<br>Her admirer attempted to take the rebuff in stride, but it was clearly not the sort of thing he was used to hearing from the lips of a woman. His paunches slowly shifted position and became a frown.<br>"I ain't gonna hug-dance with you if you talk to me like that," he said, attempting to jest. "I ain't out to rape you. I just want to sit down and rest a minute, maybe talk, you know."<br>Patsy was silent, hoping he would simply go away, but his face remained squarely in the window.<br>"I'm probably gonna get bucked off a bull tonight," he said finally. "Here I am drunk as dawg shit, I'll probably get my stupid ass stomped. Least you could do is be friendly." At the thought of his own peril his tone grew slightly husky and his frown more melancholy.<br>Patsy didn't melt with sympathy, but what he said did make it seem funny again. She had been about to get scared.<br>"That's a pity," she said. "We all have problems. Now please listen -- the point is that I don't want you to get in and sit down. Just please go on away. If you're planning to get stomped maybe you better not refill your bladder after all."<br>Ed Boggs drew back. He had reached his wits' end. "What's my goddam bladder got to do with it?" he asked loudly. "That's twice you done mentioned it. I just want to get in and sit down."<br>He paused. "You're a good-lookin' thing, you know," he said, remembering that a compliment had got him his only smile.<br>"No," Patsy said, suddenly scared. He was terribly big and loud and she didn't know how to get rid of him. "You leave me completely alone! Don't you know better than to urinate on people's cars? It's very rude. I'm married, I told you. You ought to sober up instead of standing there trying to think of some way to seduce me." She started crying and began to roll the car window up.<br>At that Ed Boggs stepped away from the car. "Well, good snoozin'," he said angrily. "I'm glad I ain't the one that's married to you. I got better sense than to screw a woman as wordy as you are, anyway."<br>Patsy stopped the window halfway up and they regarded each other for a moment through the deepening dusk. Then Mr. Boggs stalked off, his dignity secure, and Patsy rolled her window back down and sat crying. Tears ran off her cheeks, into the hollows of her throat, down her chest. She could never find a Kleenex when she was crying and could only wipe the tears away with her fingers. Soon enough she stopped and felt more calm. She cried easily -- absurdly easily, she felt. Half the things she cried about were merely silly. Her cheeks stung a little from the tears, but that soon stopped too and they felt cool.<br>By the time she was through crying it had grown quite dark, so dark that she could barely see the sorrel horse. She wished Jim was there so she could tell him about Ed Boggs. To her left, across the parking lot, she could see the glow from the circle of lights above the open-air dance floor, and she tried for a moment to imagine what it would have been like to go to a dance with such a man. Crushing, she imagined, but then she felt a little annoyed at her own fastidiousness. He might have been a good dancer. The remark about her being too talkative to sleep with rankled, though. It had obviously been sour grapes.<br>Far to the northwest there were flickerings of lightning. The quietness was broken by a splashing near at hand, a steady splashing that carried with it an odor like wet hay. The patient sorrel horse was pissing too. Patsy looked and saw the arena lights faintly reflected in the spreading puddle. In an instant it lifted her spirits, and she wished again that her husband was there. It was just the kind of coincidence he loved -- the kind that might happen in life but that could never be made to work in a novel. Jim had tried to write a novel the first year they were married and had made it over a hundred pages before he got diverted.<br>When the splashing stopped, Patsy felt even fonder of the horse than she had originally. She decided to get out and pet him. He was good company, and he seemed to have a sense of the absurd. Just as she was opening the car door she thought she heard someone call her name. She saw no one and was puzzled, until she realized that her name had come over the public address system. The rodeo announcer had called her name.<br>"WILL MRS. JAMES CARPENTER PLEASE COME TO THE JUDGES' STAND. MRS. JAMES CARPENTER."<br>Scared, aflutter, she started off immediately and got two pickups away before she remembered her purse. She might need it. Jim was hurt, she knew. Her chest felt tight. She hurried back and got her purse, looked futilely for some Kleenex, and then turned and ran through the cars and trucks toward the arena. Perhaps he had tried to take a picture of a bull and been gored. She began to cry and a few strands of hair stuck to her wet cheek.<br>As she came dashing out of the parking area, a roper who was warming up his roping mare came within a foot of running her down. Patsy hardly saw the horse, but she felt the rush of its body past hers. She was out of breath and slowed to a walk. The roper whirled his mare and came back -- he was unnerved and furious.<br>"Let's look where you're goin', lady," he said. "This ain't no damn track meet. I coulda broke your neck."<br>"I'm sorry," Patsy said, sniffing and trying to get her breath. "I'm afraid my husband's been gored. If you could show me the way to the judges' stand I'll try and stay out of your way."<br>The roper was a thin young man, no older than Patsy. When he saw how pretty she was, and how distressed, he cooled off at once and got down from his horse to help. He held a rope in one hand and had a contestant's number pinned to the back of his shirt.<br>"I'm Royce Jones," he said. "Sorry I blew off. You scared the daylights out of me. How'd he get gored, bulldoggin'?"<br>He spoke quite calmly, as if a goring were something that came to one occasionally, like a toothache, and his spurs jingled lightly as he walked beside her -- a comforting masculine sound.<br>"He's probably just got raked alongside the ribs," he added, to soothe her. "Always happens sooner or later, doggin'."<br>"Oh, no, no," Patsy said. "He's a photographer, sort of. I don't really know what's happened to him."<br>Royce Jones grinned at her in the tolerant way men of experience grin at the folly of women. Distressed as she was, it annoyed her a little.<br>"I doubt he's gored," he said. "Them steers wouldn't take after a photographer. He probably just wants you to bring him some flashbulbs. Ask the clown, he'll know. That's him there with the cop."<br>Patsy saw the clown and the cop and turned to thank Royce Jones, but he had mounted his mare and was already riding away. When he was halfway across the dusty road he stood up in his stirrups and turned and waved his rope at her, as if to acknowledge the thanks he hadn't waited to receive.<br>As Patsy turned back toward the arena she bumped smack into a little girl who had been racing along carrying a Sno-cone. The Sno-cone popped out of its cup and felt on Patsy's foot, and the little girl looked at her angrily and neglected to hold the cup upright, so the lump of ice was followed by a stream of strawberry-colored water, part of which splashed on Patsy's ankles.<br>"Oh, damn," she said. "Why can't anyone see me coming? Don't worry, I'll buy you another one. I've got some money right here."<br>"Okay," the little girl said smugly. She knew the world owed her a new Sno-cone. "My name's Fayette," she added in a chummier tone.<br>Part of the ice Patsy managed to kick off, but most of it slid into her pump and began to melt beneath her instep and trickle between her toes. She dug in her purse but could find nothing smaller than a dollar. It made her feel a little desperate. Jim was somewhere, probably hurt, and the world was coming to an end amid an absolutely ridiculous mess involving her. Something in her rebelled against giving the little girl the whole dollar. She had taken a dislike to the little girl, and she hated to be exploited by anyone she disliked. She felt that her nerves were beginning to split and curl like the ends of her hair sometimes did, and she was on the point of raking things wildly out of her purse when she looked up and saw the clown approaching. He had on baggy overalls, a ridiculous derby hat, and red and white greasepaint.<br>"I bet you're Mrs. Carpenter," he said in a quiet, agreeable voice. It was in complete contrast to his garish appearance.<br>"I'm so rattled I'm not sure," Patsy said. "Do you have any change?"<br>But he had squatted down and was already holding out a dime to the little girl. "I seen your plight," he said, glancing up at Patsy.<br>Fayette was slightly awed by the clown, but not too awed to be practical. "They cost fifteen cents now," she said. "Do you still have your skunk?"<br>Patsy would have liked to kick her, but the clown stood up and pulled a quarter out of his pocket. "If you got a nickel you can buy one for your little sister too," he said.<br>"I only got brothers. Did your skunk die?"<br>"No, it got stolen in Tucumcari."<br>The quarter grew bigger in her mind and Fayette said a perfunctory thanks and rushed off to find her best girl friend and tell her about the skunk.<br>"Thank you so much," Patsy said. "I guess I'm scared -- my legs are shaking. Could I lean on you for one second? I've got a Snocone in my shoe."<br>She handed him her purse, quickly emptied the water out of her pump, and, with one hand on his shoulder, slipped the shoe back on. "How did you know me?" she asked.<br>"Kind of an educated guess," he said.

Arranged chronologically within seven geographical sections, it offers an astonishing array of sculptures in wood, bronze, stone, and gold, as well as mural paintings, ceremonial pieces, ceramics, jewelry, and textiles culled from private and public collections around the world. Commentary by renowned scholars illuminates the cultural and historical significance of these pieces, and in-depth authoritative texts highlight critical aspects of each region. Together these words and images take readers on an artistic grand tour through a continent of unparalleled diversity, and towards the thrilling discovery of not one Africa, but many.</p></p><p>The contents are arranged geographically in a 'grand tour' that divides the continent into seven areas. Beginning with Ancient Egypt and Nubia, the tour proceeds through Ethiopia and the Sudan to the eastern coast and southern Africa, then moves up through central Africa to the coastal areas of west Africa and the countries of the sub-Saharan region. The survey ends in northern Africa, coming full circle with a discussion of Egypt in its Christian and Islamic periods. <p>Within each of these seven sections objects are arranged in broadly chronological order. They demonstrate the wide range of styles in African art, inspired by different religions and cultures, and the equally astonishing variety of materials, from dung to gold and including bronze, ivory and terracotta, as well as superb wood-carvings from all over the continent. Works of art from major public and private collections in Europe and the USA are juxtaposed with the finest from Africa itself.</p>The Editor <p>Tom Phillips is an internationally established artist and Royal Acamedician as well as being a writer on art and contributor to "Anthropology Today". He has been an active collector of African art for 25 years and in 1976 co-curated the exhibition "African Art from London Collections" at the South London Art Gallery.</p></p><h2>An Elementary Introduction to the Theory of Probability (Dover Books on Mathematics)</h2><p><p>This compact volume equips the reader with all the facts and principles essential to a fundamental understanding of the theory of probability. It is an introduction, no more: throughout the book the authors discuss the theory of probability for situations having only a finite number of possibilities, and the mathematics employed is held to the elementary level. But within its purposely restricted range it is extremely thorough, well organized, and absolutely authoritative. It is the only English translation of the latest revised Russian edition; and it is the only current translation on the market that has been checked and approved by Gnedenko himself.<br>After explaining in simple terms the meaning of the concept of probability and the means by which an event is declared to be in practice, impossible, the authors take up the processes involved in the calculation of probabilities. They survey the rules for addition and multiplication of probabilities, the concept of conditional probability, the formula for total probability, Bayes's formula, Bernoulli's scheme and theorem, the concepts of random variables, insufficiency of the mean value for the characterization of a random variable, methods of measuring the variance of a random variable, theorems on the standard deviation, the Chebyshev inequality, normal laws of distribution, distribution curves, properties of normal distribution curves, and related topics.<br>The book is unique in that, while there are several high school and college textbooks available on this subject, there is no other popular treatment for the layman that contains quite the same material presented with the same degree of clarity and authenticity. Anyone who desires a fundamental grasp of this increasingly important subject cannot do better than to start with this book. New preface for Dover edition by B. V.

Now, eminent philosopher Simon Blackburn offers the most authoritative and up-to-date dictionary of philosophy available in a single volume. Ranging from Aristotle to Zen, the two thousand plus entries cover the entire span of philosophy, from the Vedas (written over three thousand years ago) to the most recent technical terminology, with ample coverage of important themes from Chinese, Indian, Islamic, and Jewish philosophy. Here are all the terms one would expect to find in a comprehensive dictionary of philosophy--idealism and empiricism, ethics and aesthetics, Epicureanism and Stoicism, existentialism and logical positivism, and much more. Blackburn also defines many concepts not normally found in such reference works, including entries for apathy, laughter, and the meaning of life, and he includes relevant terms from disciplines such as mathematics, physics, biology, artificial intelligence, and linguistics. In addition, there are capsule biographies of nearly five hundred individuals, from the pre-Socratics to such contemporary figures as Jacques Derrida, Michel Foucault, Richard Rorty, and Simone de Beauvoir.</p><p><br><strong>Simon Blackburn</strong> is Professor of Philosophy at the University of Cambridge. He was a Fellow and Tutor at Pembroke College, Oxford from 1969 to 1990. Best-selling author of <em>Being Good: A Short Introduction to Ethics</em>, and <em>Think: A Compelling Introduction to Philosophy</em>, he also edited the journal <em>Mind</em> from 1984 to 1990.<br>In his preface to the first edition, reprinted here, the author states that his "own interests and assessments are not always disguised." This is true of the second edition as well, providing such delicious morsels as, in the entry on Jacques Derrida, "Derrida's work . . . is not easily assimilated by people used to normal expressions of thought." Nevertheless, the vast majority of entries are admirably objective. Blackburn's preference is for--and expertise lies in--the branch of the Western philosophical tradition culminating in academic Anglo-American philosophy. <p>Although the book jacket claims this to be a "vastly expanded second edition, with over 500 new entries," there is no indication in the new preface or elsewhere what these new entries are. The page count has not altered significantly from the first edition. More than 500 of the new edition's more than 3,000 entries are biographical, including non-Western thinkers such as Confucius and Kitaro Nishida and nonphilosophers such as Dante and Freud. Among the terms covered are <i>Apathy, Capitalism, Environmental ethics, Hedonism, Hatha-yoga, Taoism, Ontology, Self-deception, Turing machine, Vedanta, Whig view of history,</i> and <i>Welfare.</i> Entries range in length from a sentence (e.g., <i>Formal implication, Free variable</i>) to nearly two pages (e.g., <i>Kant, Immanuel</i>). There is extensive cross-referencing within and between the lucid entries. Concluding the volume are an appendix of logical symbols and a chronology of important philosophical and other cultural dates.</p><p>The second edition's jacket quotes the <i>Times Literary Supplement</i> on the first edition: "the most comprehensive dictionary of philosophy in English." This is no longer true and was perhaps untrue even in 1996. In the last 10 years, a variety of excellent -single-author and multiple-author one-volume philosophical dictionaries, encyclopedias, and "companions" have become available (not to mention far more extensive print and Internet references). Each offers entries and viewpoints not found in any of the others so it makes good sense to have more than one. <i>The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy</i> is an excellent choice for public and academic libraries. <i>Craig Bunch</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Suzuki introduces Emanuel Swedenborg and compares Swedenborgian thought to Buddhism. The first work stresses Swedenborg&#39;s message that true spirituality demands an engagement in this world; the second compares Swedenborg&#39;s description of heaven to the paradise of Pure Land Buddhism.</p><p>Daisetz Teitaro Suzuki was Japan&#39;s foremost authority on Zen Buddhism, and the author of over 100 works on the subject. He was trained as a Buddhist disciple in the great Zen monastery at Kamakura. From 1897 to 1908 he worked in the United States as an editor and translator, and later became a lecturer at Tokyo Imperial University. In 1950, at 80, he returned to the United States and spent most of the decade teaching, lecturing, and writing, particularly at Columbia and Harvard. Returning to Japan, he died in Tokyo in 1966 at the age of 95. Christopher Reed has been teaching Buddhism and Buddhist meditation for 15 years. He received transmission as a Dharma teacher from Zen master Thich Nhat Hanh. He has been influenced by the tradition of socially/politically engaged Buddhism, and works toward the integration of traditional Buddhist teaching with the demands of everyday life. He is co-founder and director of the Ordinary Dharma Meditation Center in Los Angeles and the Manzanita Village Retreat Center in San Diego. Andrew Bernstein holds a Ph.D. in Philosophy from the Graduate School of the City University of New York. He teaches Philosophy at Pace University in Pleasantville, New York, and at the State University of New York at Purchase. Dr. Bernstein is a speaker for the Ayn Rand Institute and lecturer on Ayn Rand&#39;s novels throughout the United States.<p>"Previously, I noted that the essence of heaven is innocence and that, because this innocence cannot be achieved through ordinary knowledge, it must be reached through a perfect enlightenment beyond knowledge. What I call enlightenment is the perception that we cannot independently achieve good separate from the Lord God in heaven. Without this perception, we cannot attain innocence.</p><p>"Since heaven derives from innocence, its opposite, hell, would have to signify non-innocence. In other words, those who believe in self-power without relying on other-power will always fall into hell. When my ego's purpose suddenly arises, I shoot into hell like an arrow. The purpose of ego, according to Swedenborg, is self-love and worldly love. When the vault of hell is opened, the raging fire and smoke that one sees rising up is what springs from the blaze of these two loves. Those who are in hell in bodily form are completely consumed by these flames. As I said before, there is also heat in heaven, the heat of divine love. However, this heat is like the warmth of spring, and once this warmth flows into the blade of hell, the blaze cools and becomes extremely cold. The heat of heaven acts in this mysterious way. Flowing from the depths of the Divine is a power that cannot be judged by human perception."</p></p><h2>Power, State, and Society: An Introduction to Poltical Sociology</h2><p>Political sociologists probe into thorny issues, ask tough questions, and reveal obscure truths; often what they learn is neither simple nor comforting. By exploring how societal power relationships and political actions combine to create a particular societal situation, such as homelessness or street crime, one develops a critical understanding of the dynamics of the power dimensions of human relationships, group processes, and social institutions. This well-organized introduction to political sociology provides a comprehensive synthesis of complex ideas, makes theory come alive, and highlights contemporary developments in the field. Early in the text, Neuman presents theoretical frameworks as models to understand political sociology; he makes abstract material understandable and relevant. Understanding how power relations constantly shape many areas of our daily life results in greater control over events and an improved quality of life.

In this book, Sir Ken argues that organisations everywhere are struggling to fix a problem that originates in schools and universities. Organisations everywhere are competing in a world that changes in the blink of an eye &#x2013; they need people who are flexible enough to adapt, and creative enough to find novel solutions to problems old and new. <i>Out of Our Minds</i> describes how schools, businesses and communities can work together to bring creativity out of the closet and realise its inherent value at every stage of life.

The eighteen essays cover the following topics: power, fame, equality, lying, toleration, travel, virtue, collective responsibility, the wheel of fortune, betrayal, violence, boredom, freedom, luxury, God, respect for nature, superstition, and national stereotypes.</p><p><b>Leszek Kolakowski</b> is currently senior research fellow at All Souls College, Oxford.

But today, these much-touted strategies may be risky. Global financial turmoil, rising labor costs in developing countries, and huge volatility in the price of oil and other commodities can disrupt a company's entire supply chain and threaten its ability to compete. In <i>Operations Rules</i>, David Simchi-Levi identifies the crucial element in a company's success: the link between the value it provides its customers and its operations strategies. And he offers a set of scientifically and empirically based rules that management can follow to achieve a quantum leap in operations performance.</p><p>Flexibility, says Simchi-Levi, is the single most important capability that allows firms to innovate in their operations and supply chain strategies. A small investment in flexibility can achieve almost all the benefits of full flexibility. And successful companies do not all pursue the same strategies. Amazon and Wal-Mart, for example, are direct competitors but each focuses on a different market channel and provides a unique customer value proposition&#x2015;Amazon, large selection and reliable fulfillment; Wal-Mart, low prices&#x2015;that directly aligns with its operations strategy. Simchi-Levi's rules&#x2015;regarding such issues as channels, price, product characteristics, value-added service, procurement strategy, and information technolog&#x2015;-transform operations and supply chain management from an undertaking based on gut feeling and anecdotes to a science.</p></p><p>"From managing risk by focusing on flexibility to choosing the right IT investments, this book can help companies navigate today's supply chain challenges and achieve a quantum leap in operations performance." Hasso Plattner, Co-Founder of SAP and Chairman of the SAP Supervisory Board<br><br>"Companies today are faced with an increasing number of choices in operational and supply chain strategies.

Jim Champy, Coauthor of <i>Reengineering the Corporation</i><br><i></i><br>"This well written book provides guidelines that can help managers address today's business challenges such as risk and market volatility.

In 1847, he joined a mutiny on a ship where the crew were arguing with the owners over their share of the profits. For this, Melville was thrown into a jail in Tahiti.

His life had been a difficult one and his literary merits had reaped him little profit.CHAPTER 1<br> LOOMINGS<br> Call me Ishmael. Some years ago--never mind how long precisely--having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen, and regulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking people's hats off--then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball. With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I quietly take to the ship. There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me.<br><br> There now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by wharves as Indian isles by coral reefs--commerce surrounds it with her surf. Right and left, the streets take you waterward. Its extreme down-town is the battery, where that noble mole is washed by waves, and cooled by breezes, which a few hours previous were out of sight of land. Look at the crowds of water-gazers there.<br><br> Circumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon. Go from Corlears Hook to Coenties Slip, and from thence, by Whitehall, northward. What do you see?--Posted like silent sentinels all around the town, stand thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries. Some leaning against the spiles; some seated upon the pier-heads; some looking over the bulwarks of ships from China; some high aloft in the rigging, as if striving to get a still better seaward peep. But these are all landsmen; of week days pent up in lath and plaster--tied to counters, nailed to benches, clinched to desks. How then is this? Are the green fields gone? What do they here?<br><br> But look! here come more crowds, pacing straight for the water, and seemingly bound for a dive. Strange! Nothing will content them but the extremest limit of the land; loitering under the shady lee of yonder warehouses will not suffice. No. They must get just as nigh the water as they possibly can without falling in. And there they stand--miles of them--leagues. Inlanders all, they come from lanes and alleys, streets and avenues--north, east, south, and west. Yet here they all unite. Tell me, does the magnetic virtue of the needles of the compasses of all those ships attract them thither?<br><br> Once more. Say, you are in the country; in some high land of lakes. Take almost any path you please, and ten to one it carries you down in a dale, and leaves you there by a pool in the stream. There is magic in it. Let the most absentminded of men be plunged in his deepest reveries--stand that man on his legs, set his feet a-going, and he will infallibly lead you to water, if water there be in all that region. Should you ever be athirst in the great American desert, try this experiment, if your caravan happen to be supplied with a metaphysical professor. Yes, as every one knows, meditation and water are wedded for ever.<br><br> But here is an artist. He desires to paint you the dreamiest, shadiest, quietest, most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all the valley of the Saco. What is the chief element he employs? There stand his trees, each with a hollow trunk, as if a hermit and a crucifix were within; and here sleeps his meadow, and there sleep his cattle; and up from yonder cottage goes a sleepy smoke. Deep into distant woodlands winds a mazy way, reaching to overlapping spurs of mountains bathed in their hill-side blue. But though the picture lies thus tranced, and though this pine-tree shakes down its sighs like leaves upon this shepherd's head, yet all were vain, unless the shepherd's eye were fixed upon the magic stream before him. Go visit the Prairies in June, when for scores on scores of miles you wade knee-deep among Tiger-lilies--what is the one charm wanting?--Water--there is not a drop of water there! Were Niagara but a cataract of sand, would you travel your thousand miles to see it? Why did the poor poet of Tennessee, upon suddenly receiving two handfuls of silver, deliberate whether to buy him a coat, which he sadly needed, or invest his money in a pedestrian trip to Rockaway Beach? Why is almost every robust healthy boy with a robust healthy soul in him, at some time or other crazy to go to sea? Why upon your first voyage as a passenger, did you yourself feel such a mystical vibration, when first told that you and your ship were now out of sight of land? Why did the old Persians hold the sea holy? Why did the Greeks give it a separate deity, and own brother of Jove? Surely all this is not without meaning. And still deeper the meaning of that story of Narcissus, who because he could not grasp the tormenting, mild image he saw in the fountain, plunged into it and was drowned. But that same image, we ourselves see in all rivers and oceans. It is the image of the ungraspable phantom of life; and this is the key to it all.<br><br> Now, when I say that I am in the habit of going to sea whenever I begin to grow hazy about the eyes, and begin to be over conscious of my lungs, I do not mean to have it inferred that I ever go to sea as a passenger. For to go as a passenger you must needs have a purse, and a purse is but a rag unless you have something in it. Besides, passengers get sea-sick--grow quarrelsome--don't sleep of nights--do not enjoy themselves much, as a general thing;--no, I never go as a passenger; nor, though I am something of a salt, do I ever go to sea as a Commodore, or a Captain, or a Cook. I abandon the glory and distinction of such offices to those who like them. For my part, I abominate all honorable respectable toils, trials, and tribulations of every kind whatsoever. It is quite as much as I can do to take care of myself, without taking care of ships, barques, brigs, schooners, and what not. And as for going as cook,--though I confess there is considerable glory in that, a cook being a sort of officer on ship-board--yet, somehow, I never fancied broiling fowls;--though once broiled, judiciously buttered, and judgmatically salted and peppered, there is no one who will speak more respectfully, not to say reverentially, of a broiled fowl than I will. It is out of the idolatrous dotings of the old Egyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted river horse, that you see the mummies of those creatures in their huge bake-houses the pyramids.<br><br> No, when I go to sea, I go as a simple sailor, right before the mast, plumb down into the forecastle, aloft there to the royal mast-head. True, they rather order me about some, and make me jump from spar to spar, like a grasshopper in a May meadow. And at first, this sort of thing is unpleasant enough. It touches one's sense of honor, particularly if you come of an old established family in the land, the Van Rensselaers, or Randolphs, or Hardicanutes. And more than all, if just previous to putting your hand into the tar-pot, you have been lording it as a country schoolmaster, making the tallest boys stand in awe of you. The transition is a keen one, I assure you, from a schoolmaster to a sailor, and requires a strong decoction of Seneca and the Stoics to enable you to grin and bear it. But even this wears off in time.<br><br> What of it, if some old hunks of a sea-captain orders me to get a broom and sweep down the decks? What does that indignity amount to, weighed, I mean, in the scales of the New Testament? Do you think the archangel Gabriel thinks anything the less of me, because I promptly and respectfully obey that old hunks in that particular instance? Who ain't a slave? Tell me that. Well, then, however the old sea-captains may order me about--however they may thump and punch me about, I have the satisfaction of knowing that it is all right; that everybody else is one way or other served in much the same way--either in a physical or metaphysical point of view, that is; and so the universal thump is passed round, and all hands should rub each other's shoulder-blades, and be content.<br><br> Again, I always go to sea as a sailor, because they make a point of paying me for my trouble, whereas they never pay passengers a single penny that I ever heard of. On the contrary, passengers themselves must pay. And there is all the difference in the world between paying and being paid. The act of paying is perhaps the most uncomfortable infliction that the two orchard thieves entailed upon us. But being paid,--what will compare with it? The urbane activity with which a man receives money is really marvellous, considering that we so earnestly believe money to be the root of all earthly ills, and that on no account can a monied man enter heaven. Ah! how cheerfully we consign ourselves to perdition!<br><br> Finally, I always go to sea as a sailor, because of the wholesome exercise and pure air of the forecastle deck. For as in this world, head winds are far more prevalent than winds from astern (that is, if you never violate the Pythagorean maxim), so for the most part the Commodore on the quarter-deck gets his atmosphere at second hand from the sailors on the forecastle. He thinks he breathes it first; but not so. In much the same way do the commonalty lead their leaders in many other things, at the same time that the leaders little suspect it. But wherefore it was that after having repeatedly smelt the sea as a merchant sailor, I should now take it into my head to go on a whaling voyage; this the invisible police officer of the Fates, who has the constant surveillance of me, and secretly dogs me, and influences me in some unaccountable way--he can better answer than any one else. And, doubtless, my going on this whaling voyage, formed part of the grand programme of Providence that was drawn up a long time ago. It came in as a sort of brief interlude and solo between more extensive performances. I take it that this part of the bill must have run something like this:<br> "grand contested election for the presidency of the united states.<br><br> "whaling voyage by one ishmael.<br><br> "bloody battle in afghanistan."<br> Though I cannot tell why it was exactly that those stage managers, the Fates, put me down for this shabby part of a whaling voyage, when others were set down for magnificent parts in high tragedies, and short and easy parts in genteel comedies, and jolly parts in farces--though I cannot tell why this was exactly; yet, now that I recall all the circumstances, I think I can see a little into the springs and motives which being cunningly presented to me under various disguises, induced me to set about performing the part I did, besides cajoling me into the delusion that it was a choice resulting from my own unbiased freewill and discriminating judgment.<br><br> Chief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of the great whale himself. Such a portentous and mysterious monster roused all my curiosity. Then the wild and distant seas where he rolled his island bulk; the undeliverable, nameless perils of the whale; these, with all the attending marvels of a thousand Patagonian sights and sounds, helped to sway me to my wish. With other men, perhaps, such things would not have been inducements; but as for me, I am tormented with an everlasting itch for things remote. I love to sail forbidden seas, and land on barbarous coasts. Not ignoring what is good, I am quick to perceive a horror, and could still be social with it--would they let me--since it is but well to be on friendly terms with all the inmates of the place one lodges in.<br><br> By reason of these things, then, the whaling voyage was welcome; the great flood-gates of the wonder-world swung open, and in the wild conceits that swayed me to my purpose, two and two there floated into my inmost soul, endless processions of the whale, and, mid most of them all, one grand hooded phantom, like a snow hill in the air.</p><h2>Writing: A Guide for College and Beyond, MLA Update Edition</h2><p><p> <i>For courses in English Composition. <br> </i> </p> <p> <i> <i>This&nbsp;version&nbsp;of </i> </i> <i> <i> <i>Writing: A Guide for College and Beyond</i> </i> has been updated to reflect the 8th Edition of the MLA Handbook&nbsp;(April 2016)* </i> </p> <p> <br> <b>Revealing the writing process through interactive learning</b> <br> <i> <b>Writing: A Guide for College and Beyond</b> </i> presents writing, reading, and research processes dynamically, using a variety of visuals to illustrate how readers interact with texts and how writers compose.

This reference work, now in its third edition, has been and will continue to be an invaluable source of help to the student. Professor Farrell always takes common English terms - whether concrete or abstract - as his starting point and lists them alphabetically, often in groups of similar meanings and often with their standard dictionary definitions. German synonyms are then given for each different meaning, accompanied by their definitions and numerous pithy sentences illustrating their usage. Explanatory footnotes complement textual comments on individual difficulties. The two word lists of English and German words included in the Dictionary enable the reader to turn easily to the particular word or words he is interested in. For the third edition of the Dictionary, the text has been thoroughly revised and misprints and errors have been corrected: where space permitted, attempts have also been made to improve example sentences and explanations. Professor Farrell has added, as an appendix, his commentary on certain German words which frequently pose problems, either because their meaning is not readily understood or because they have no exact equivalent in English.</p><p>This new edition of a standard work is corrected throughout with improved example sentences and added comments.

Abolitionist, proto-feminist, friend to such Indian leaders as Joseph Brant, Burr was personally acquainted with a wider range of Americans, and of the American continent, than any other Founder except George Washington. He contested for power with Hamilton and then with Jefferson on a continental scale. The book does not sentimentalize any of its three protagonists, neither does it derogate their extraordinary qualities. They were all great men, all flawed, and all three failed to achieve their full aspirations. But their struggles make for an epic tale. <br> Written from the perspective of a historian and administrator who, over nearly fifty years in public life, has served six presidents, this book penetrates into the personal qualities of its three central figures. In telling the tale of their shifting power relationships and their antipathies, it reassesses their policies and the consequences of their successes and failures. Fresh information about the careers of Hamilton and Burr is derived from newly-discovered sources, and a supporting cast of secondary figures emerges to give depth and irony to the principal narrative. This is a book for people who know how political life is lived, and who refuse to be confined within preconceptions and prejudices until they have weighed all the evidence, to reach their own conclusions both as to events and character. <br> This is a controversial book, but not a confrontational one, for it is written with sympathy for men of high aspirations, who were disappointed in much, but who succeeded, in all three cases, to a degree not hitherto fully understood.</p><p><br><strong>Roger G. Kennedy</strong> has served as Director of The National Park Service, as Director of The Smithsonian's National Museum of American History, and as Vice President, Finance, of the Ford Foundation. He has written nine books, has appeared in his own series on the Discovery Channel, and was a White House correspondent for NBC. He lives in Santa Fe, New Mexico.<br>In a study of three Founders, Kennedy, director emeritus of the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History and a prolific author (Hidden Cities, 1994, etc.), demonstrates his devotion to underdogs, in particular Aaron Burr. New York attorney general and vice president of the US, Burr was once tapped as Jefferson's successor to the presidency, but his political career shriveled when he lost a gubernatorial election, and in 1806, Jefferson accused him of treason. His papers were lost, and his daughter, his most promising hagiographer, died before beginning a biography of her dad. That 19th-century notables including Harriet Beecher Stowe and John Quincy Adams maligned Burr as a womanizing rapscallion didn't help Burr's reputation. A spin doctor's nightmare? In Kennedy's hands, Burr appears admirable: a proto-feminist, taken with Mary Wollstonecraft's writings; a defender of Kennedy's other favorite underdog, Native Americans; and a committed abolitionist. Kennedy explores the careers and characters of Hamilton and Jefferson as well, arguing that they cannot be understood without first knowing Burr. If Burr is the hero of this book, neither Jefferson nor Hamilton is quite the villaineach was ``ambitious,'' each ``on occasion noble, generous, and touching in [his] willingness to express [his] affections.'' Kennedy has a penchant for unsubstantiated psychobabble. Pause critically when he waxes Oprah-esque about the psychic damage done to Burr and Hamilton by traumatic childhoods; raise a quizzical eyebrow at his suggestion that Jefferson's vitriol was stoked by Burr's matchmakingin introducing James Madison to Dolley Payne, Burr no doubt altered the relationship of ``the great little Madison'' and the Sage of Monticello, two ``brilliant and lonely men'' who had toiled together as ``bachelor partners'' for 14 years after the death of Jefferson's wife, though that's hardly grounds for branding your VP a traitor. Kennedy is no Gore Vidal, yet, in an engaging and lightly ironic tone, he offers a worthwhile portrait of powerful politicians in early America.

Though it seems inconceivable that Picasso, Giorgio de Chirico, Rodin, or Matisse ever had to be &#34;introduced,&#34; they were in fact presented to American society and de Zayas&#39;s essays and commentary are credited with providing the intellectual foundation with which to understand and appreciate these artistic developments. Editor Naumann has done a fine job constructing several appendices detailing exhibition information, correspondence, and press reviews. The photograph selection is well-considered and features some representations of work which has been lost or destroyed. Annotation c. by Book News, Inc., Portland, Or.</p><p>Francis M. Naumann is author of numerous articles and exhibition catalogues. In 1987 he coedited (with Rudolf E. Kuenzli) <i>Marcel Duchamp: Artist of the Century</i>, and he is author of <i>New York Dada</i>, a book considered to be the definitive history of the movement.In 1907, de Zayas and the rest of his family was forced into exile for his father's opposition to Mexican president Porfirio Diaz. Shortly after arriving in New York, de Zayas took up his own cause: a writer, caricaturist and close associate of Alfred Stieglitz, he became a perceptive and unrepentant propagandist for the avant garde. In the late 1940s, at the urging of the Museum of Modern Art's director, Alfred Barr, de Zayas pulled together this dissection of the "hard labor" of introducing modernism to New York. His commentary, dated but still lively, emerges as though from a time capsule from an era when modernist art had the power to shock and offend. Chronological sections describing exhibits at Stieglitz's "291" Gallery and it's spinoff, de Zayas's own Modern Gallery, illustrate the initial American response to artists who have since been canonized, from Matisse and Picabia to Picasso and Cezanne. Many American critics writing for the mainstream press simply despised their work. Three decades later, de Zayas quoted from those reviews with impunity knowing that history had already vindicated his critical acumen. While some of his comments seem antiquated, the value of this book is its immediacy. De Zayas was one of the first writers to attempt to explain the tenets of modernism to the American public, and his prose reveals an insider's perspective on a seminal moment in art history. Although a more detailed introduction to this edition would have been helpful, Naumann (New York Dada) has included appendices of real historical interest, from the author's correspondence with Stieglitz to exhibition lists from the Modern and the de Zayas galleries. <br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Communication as Culture: An Introduction to the Communication Process</h2><p><p>Far from being a context in which communication occurs, culture is the very basis of communication.</p><p><strong><em>Communication as Culture&nbsp;</em></strong>explains that whether people talk with&nbsp;family members or someone from another country, they are never anything more or less than enculturated people who&nbsp;abide by the limits of their&nbsp;language, values and ideals.

Back in print for the first time in years, Barrett&#x2019;s seminal book reveals how Trump put together the biggest deal of his life&#x2014;Trump Tower&#x2014;through manipulation and deceit; how he worked with questionable characters from the mafia and city politics; and how it all nearly came crashing down. Here is a vivid and inglorious portrait of the man who wants now to be the most powerful man in the world.<br> <br> In&nbsp;<i>Trump: The Greatest Show in the World&#x2014;The Deals, the Downfall, the Reinvention</i>, Barrett unravels the myth and reveals the truth behind the mogul&#x2019;s wheelings and dealings. After decades covering him, few reporters know Trump as Barrett does. Instead of the canny businessman that Trump claims in his own books, Barrett explores how Trump exploited his father&#x2019;s banking and political connections to finance and grease his first major deals. Barrett&#x2019;s investigative biography takes us from the days of Donald&#x2019;s lonely youth to his brash entry into the real estate market, and to the back room deals behind his New York, Atlantic City and Florida projects.<br> <br> Most compellingly Barrett paints an intimate portrait of Trump himself, a man driven by bravado, obsessive self-regard, and an anxious ruthlessness to subdue his rivals and seduce anyone with the power to aid his empire. We see him head to head with an opponent as powerful as Pete Rozelle, ingratiating himself with the brooding governor on the Hudson, and fueling the Drexel engine driven by Michael Milken with hundreds of millions in fees&#x2014;paid, ironically, by gaming companies to fend off Trump takeovers. We explore his complicated emotional and business relationship with his first wife, Ivana, and the use he planned to make of his mistress&#x2014;and later, his second wife&#x2014;Marla Maples as a &#x201c;southern strategy&#x201d; in his then contemplated presidential campaign. With interviews with scores of adversaries and former colleagues, we are given a privileged look at Trump the businessman in action&#x2014;reckless as often as he is brilliant, reliant on threats as much as on charm, and ultimately a cautionary tale: is this the man we want to lead the world?<br> <br> <b>PRAISE FOR&nbsp;<i>TRUMP:</i></b><br> <br> &#x201c;<i>Trump</i>&nbsp;is a withering portrait of the most self-mythologized and promoted businessman of our era, an exhaustively researched and long-overdue antidote to Trump&#x2019;s own books. It is a penetrating portrait of the age that spawned him and the many who aided and abetted his rise.&nbsp;<i>Trump</i>&nbsp;seems destined to be the definitive account of how Trump got ahead and why he fell.

Cook and his crew soon formed friendships&#x2014;and often more intimate relationships&#x2014;with the islanders. The islanders, who initially were not certain if the Englishmen were even human, came to experiment with Western customs and in some cases joined the voyagers on their expeditions. But familiarity quickly bred contempt. Shipboard discipline was threatened by these new relationships, and the culture of the islands was also changed forever. Captain Cook, initially determined to act as an enlightened leader, saw his resolve falter during the third voyage. Amicable relations turned hostile, culminating in Cook&#x2019;s violent death on the shores of Hawaii. In this masterful account of Cook&#x2019;s voyages, Anne Salmond&#x2014;a preeminent authority on the history of the south seas&#x2014;reimagines two worlds that collided in the eighteenth century, and the enduring impact of that collision.</p><p>&#34;The Trial of the Cannibal Dog brings us the voyages of Captain James Cook as we&#39;ve never seen them before. In Anne Salmond&#39;s hands, Pacific exploration becomes an intricate drama of mutual discovery, with Polynesians having as profound an impact on Europeans as Cook and his men had on those they encountered. Salmond&#39;s nuanced, multi-voiced book is a ground-breaking addition to the Captain Cook canon.&#34;</p><h2>The History Atlas of Africa : From the First Humans to the Emergence of a New South Africa (History Atlas Series)</h2><p>Traces the region&#39;s earliest settlers, explores the development of societies, and describes how internal and external politics have changed the borders within Africa</p><p>Samuel Kasule, a professor of African literature, offers a wide-ranging view of African history in this heavily illustrated yet slender atlas.

He wants to show them how to wrestle with a problem (one that is more sophisticated than &#34;plug and chug&#34;), how to build a solution, and ultimately he wants to teach the students to take a statement and develop a way to prove it...Gerstein writes with a certain flair that I think students will find appealing. For instance, after his discussion of cardinals he has a section entitled Languages and Finite Automata. This allows him to illustrate some of the ideas he has been discussing with problems that almost anyone can understand, but most importantly he shows how these rather transparent problems can be subjected to a mathematical analysis. His discussion of how a machine might determine whether the sequence of words &#34;Celui fromage de la parce que maintenant&#34; is a legitimate French sentence is just delightful (and even more so if one knows a little French.)...I am confident that a student who works through Gerstein&#39;s book will really come away with (i) some mathematical technique, and (ii) some mathematical knowledge. - Steven Krantz, American Mathematical Monthly &#34;This very elementary book is intended to be a textbook for a one-term course which introduces students into the basic notions of any higher mathematics courses...The explanations of the basic notions are combined with some main theorems, illustrated by examples (with solutions if necessary) and complemented by exercises. The book is well written and should be easily understandable to any beginning student.&#34; - S. Gottwald, Zentralblatt This textbook is intended for a one-term course whose goal is to ease the transition from lower-division calculus courses to upper-division courses in linear and abstract algebra, real and complex analysis, number theory, topology, combinatorics, etc. It contains a wide-ranging assortment of examples and imagery to motivate and to enhance the underlying intuitions, as well as numerous exercises and a solutions manual for professors.</p><p></p><h2>The Word Made Strange: Theology, Language, Culture</h2><p>The essays in this new book from John Milbank range over the entire field of theology, and both extend and enrich the theological perspective underlying his earlier <i>Theology and Social Theory.</i> The essays are focused around the theme of a theological approach to language, and offer a richly textured and broad ranging inquiry which will contribute to a variety of contemporary debates.</p><p>The essays in this new book from John Milbank range over the entire field of theology, and both extend and enrich the theological perspective underlying his earlier <i>Theology and Social Theory.</i> In the essays Milbank offers a theological account of language, and suggests that no secular construct of language offers any true possibility of meaning. He then applies this account across a wide range of theological topics, offering us a new theology which is orthodox in a surprising and disturbing way. Beyond the sterile alternatives of liberalism and a 'neo-orthodoxy' grown mechanical, Milbank suggests the incarnate divine word is always mediated by human discourses, yet registers its presence by transfiguring these discourses down to their very roots. <p><i>Theology, Language and Culture</i> offers a richly textured and broad ranging inquiry which will serve to enrich contemporary intellectual debates across a range of disciplines.</p><b>Professor John Milbank</b> lectures in the Department of Religious Studies at the University of Virginia.

This broad understanding of political corruption&#x2015;rooted in ideals of civic virtue&#x2015;was a driving force at the Constitutional Convention.</p><p>For two centuries the framers&#x2019; ideas about corruption flourished in the courts, even in the absence of clear rules governing voters, civil officers, and elected officials. Should a law that was passed by a state legislature be overturned because half of its members were bribed? What kinds of lobbying activity were corrupt, and what kinds were legal? When does an implicit promise count as bribery? In the 1970s the U.S. Supreme Court began to narrow the definition of corruption, and the meaning has since changed dramatically. No case makes that clearer than <i>Citizens United</i>.</p><p>In 2010, one of the most consequential Court decisions in American political history gave wealthy corporations the right to spend unlimited money to influence elections. Justice Anthony Kennedy's majority opinion treated corruption as nothing more than explicit bribery, a narrow conception later echoed by Chief Justice Roberts in deciding <i>McCutcheon v. FEC</i> in 2014. With unlimited spending transforming American politics for the worse, warns Zephyr Teachout, <i>Citizens United</i> and <i>McCutcheon</i> were not just bad law but bad history. If the American experiment in self-government is to have a future, then we must revive the traditional meaning of corruption and embrace an old ideal.</p></p><p>Zephyr Teachout is Associate Professor of Law at Fordham University.&#x201c;At last someone has written a book that puts a name to what is perhaps the most significant factor shaping American politics today: corruption. In a masterly work of scholarship, <b>Zephyr Teachout</b>...traces the history of American approaches to what was long considered a mortal threat to the republic. She demonstrates that recent jurisprudence, which has whittled down the definition of corruption to encompass only a contractual exchange between briber and public official, represents nothing less than &#x2018;a revolution in political theory.&#x2019;... Teachout calls for a return to the Framers&#x2019; preference for across-the-board rules to help prevent corrupt acts before they are perpetrated, rather than relying on punishment after the fact.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Sarah Chayes</b><b>, </b><b><i>Wall Street Journal</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;In <i>Corruption in America</i>, an eloquent, revealing, and sometimes surprising historical inquiry, <b>Teachout</b> convincingly argues that corruption, broadly understood as placing private interests over the public good in public office, is at the root of what ails American democracy.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>David Cole</b><b>, </b><b><i>New York Review of Books</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;<b>Teachout</b>&#x2019;s book is filled with colorful anecdotes about Americans getting away with all sorts of chicanery...<i>Corruption in America</i> shows that it is possible to establish and maintain governmental institutions that shield us from our worst instincts. This was the goal of Madison and his peers, and it could still be achieved with a better public-election finance system, which could be constitutional under <i>Citizens United </i>if the system did not restrict private donations. Democrats who will be looking for a fresh agenda in 2016 should read Teachout&#x2019;s book carefully.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Max Ehrenfreund</b><b>, </b><b><i>Washington Post</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;A book that merits the large readership it may get...<b>Teachout</b>&#x2019;s narrative spans the history of the United States from its beginnings through Chief Justice John Roberts&#x2019;s decision in <i>McCutcheon v. FEC</i>.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Scott McLemee</b><b>, </b><b><i>Inside Higher Ed</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;<b>Zephyr Teachout</b> argues that recent court decisions&#x2015;and a lax attitude toward corruption&#x2015;are putting private interests over the public good. Teachout complains of the revolving-door practice of congressional representatives retiring and becoming lobbyists. She says the policy breeds ethical conflicts and tainted decision-making.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Carl Campanile</b><b>, </b><b><i>New York Post</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;<b>Teachout</b>&#x2019;s beautifully written and powerful book exposes a simple but profound error at the core of the Supreme Court&#x2019;s <i>McCutcheon v. FEC</i> decision. The originalists on the Court forgot their history. This is that history&#x2015;and eventually it will provide the basis for reversing the Court&#x2019;s critical error.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Lawrence Lessig, author of <i>Republic, Lost: How Money Corrupts Congress&#x2015;and a Plan to Stop It</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;This is a wonderful and important book. <b>Zephyr Teachout</b> shows what&#x2019;s wrong with how the Supreme Court thinks about democracy and political corruption, how we got to this terrible place, and that it wasn&#x2019;t always this way&#x2015;and doesn&#x2019;t have to be. There&#x2019;s a lot of learning and original synthesis here, and also an unmistakable voice, which blends a lively intelligence with passion for democracy as a way of life.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Jedediah Purdy, author of <i>A Tolerable Anarchy: Rebels, Reactionaries, and the Making of American Freedom</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;You have probably heard pundits say we are living in an age of &#x2018;legalized bribery&#x2019;; <i>Corruption in America</i> is the book that makes their case in careful detail...State governments subject to wealthy corporations? Check. Speculators in legislation, infesting the capital? They call it K Street...And all of it has happened, <b>Teachout</b> admonishes, because the founders&#x2019; understanding of corruption has been methodically taken apart by a Supreme Court that cynically pretends to worship the founders&#x2019; every word.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Thomas Frank</b><b>, </b><b><i>New York Times Book Review</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;[<b>Teachout</b>] wrote [this] book, she says, primarily in answer to conservative members of the Supreme Court, who, in a series of decisions climaxing in <i>Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission</i> in 2010, have successively narrowed the legal definition of corruption to the point that it now effectively includes only outright bribery. In <i>Citizens United</i>, for example, the majority struck down corporate spending limits in politics on the grounds that there is nothing inherently corrupting about corporations trying to buy influence with politicians so long as there is no explicit quid pro quo. Teachout spends much of her book showing just how naive, dangerous, and, frankly, anti-American the Founding Fathers would have considered such reasoning...It is certainly refreshing to watch Teachout remind jurists who pretend to wrap themselves in the mantle of strict construction just how at odds their views of human nature and the role of government are with those of the framers.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Daniel Bush</b><b>, </b><b><i>Washington Monthly</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;[<b>Teachout</b>] has written an intelligent, stimulating, and wide-ranging retort to the Roberts Court&#x2019;s constrained view of corruption. In <i>Corruption in America</i>, she argues that for democracy to thrive, we need a far more capacious characterization of this key concept...Her book in part [is] a greatest hits of court cases and laws dealing with bribery and lobbying, full of corrupt land deals and railroad intrigue...While there is obviously plenty to debate and disagree over in how we might define and delineate corruption, the broad unsettledness of the concept is perhaps Teachout&#x2019;s point. She has some ideas on how we might think about corruption, and she highlights others&#x2019; ideas as well. But mostly, she just wants us to debate and discuss corruption more, to view it as a controversial issue, and not to let the Roberts Court sweep it away into a marginal corner so that it can then declare it irrelevant, thus clearing the way for unlimited campaign contributions...Teachout&#x2019;s book may be just the rousing call to arms we need for the fight ahead.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Lee Drutman</b><b>, </b><b><i>Democracy</i></b></p><h2>Database Design for Mere Mortals: A Hands-On Guide to Relational Database Design</h2><p><p>&#x201c;This book takes the somewhat daunting process of database design and breaks it into completely manageable and understandable components.

Three-tier, largely because of its adaptability and stability, is the norm. All of which means you need a database to underpin each of your applications. Designing your databases correctly can make the difference between slow-running, complicated code and software that's speedy, modular, and easy to work with. <i>Database Design for Mere Mortals</i> prepares someone with only a passing familiarity with databases for the important job of building the persistence layer (also called the data model) for software.<p> Michael Hernandez explains database design in tradesman's terms. That is, he shows his readers how to identify the business problems that have to be satisfied by a database, then proceeds to explain how to build a solid solution to them. Hernandez's approach combines procedural guidelines (first identify critical facts, then apply a certain logic to yield tables, then establish cross-references, and so on) with practical definitions that clear up much of the rich trove of jargon surrounding databases. He walks through numerous examples, and doesn't shy away from the complexities that always exist in real customers' requirements.

Full facsimile of the original edition, not reproduced with Optical Recognition Software. The Martino Reprint is a exact facsimile of the original 1922 Edition published in Paris by Sylvia Beach in 1922. One of the most important works of Modernist literature, &#34;Ulysses&#34; has been called &#34;a demonstration and summation of the entire modernist movement. &#34;Ulysses&#34; chronicles the passage of Leopold Bloom through Dublin during an ordinary day, 16 June 1904 (the day of Joyce&#39;s first date with his future wife, Nora Barnacle). The title alludes to Odysseus (Ulysses), the hero of Homer&#39;s Odyssey, and establishes a series of parallels between characters and events in Homer&#39;s poem and Joyce&#39;s novel (e.g., the correspondence of Leopold Bloom to Odysseus, Molly Bloom to Penelope, and Stephen Dedalus to Telemachus). The novel is approximately 265,000 words in length and uses a lexicon of 30,030 words (including proper names, plurals and various verb tenses), divided into eighteen episodes. Since publication, the book attracted controversy and scrutiny, ranging from early obscenity trials to protracted textual &#34;Joyce Wars.&#34; Ulysses&#39; stream-of-consciousness technique, careful structuring, and experimental prose-full of puns, parodies, and allusions, as well as its rich characterizations and broad humor, made the book a highly regarded novel in the Modernist pantheon. In 1998, the Modern Library ranked Ulysses first on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century.</p><p><i>Ulysses</i> has been labeled dirty, blasphemous, and unreadable. In a famous 1933 court decision, Judge John M. Woolsey declared it an emetic book--although he found it sufficiently unobscene to allow its importation into the United States--and Virginia Woolf was moved to decry James Joyce's "cloacal obsession." None of these adjectives, however, do the slightest justice to the novel. To this day it remains <i>the</i> modernist masterpiece, in which the author takes both Celtic lyricism and vulgarity to splendid extremes. It is funny, sorrowful, and even (in a close-focus sort of way) suspenseful. And despite the exegetical industry that has sprung up in the last 75 years, <i>Ulysses</i> is also a compulsively readable book. Even the verbal vaudeville of the final chapters can be navigated with relative ease, as long as you're willing to be buffeted, tickled, challenged, and (occasionally) vexed by Joyce's sheer command of the English language.<p> Among other things, a novel is simply a long story, and the first question about any story is: <i>What happens?</i>. In the case of <i>Ulysses</i>, the answer might be <i>Everything</i>. William Blake, one of literature's sublime myopics, saw the universe in a grain of sand. Joyce saw it in Dublin, Ireland, on June 16, 1904, a day distinguished by its utter normality. Two characters, Stephen Dedalus and Leopold Bloom, go about their separate business, crossing paths with a gallery of indelible Dubliners. We watch them teach, eat, stroll the streets, argue, and (in Bloom's case) masturbate. And thanks to the book's stream-of-consciousness technique--which suggests no mere stream but an impossibly deep, swift-running river--we're privy to their thoughts, emotions, and memories. The result? Almost every variety of human experience is crammed into the accordian folds of a single day, which makes <i>Ulysses</i> not just an experimental work but the very last word in realism. </p><p> Both characters add their glorious intonations to the music of Joyce's prose. Dedalus's accent--that of a freelance aesthetician, who dabbles here and there in what we might call Early Yeats Lite--will be familiar to readers of <i>Portrait of an Artist As a Young Man</i>. But Bloom's wistful sensualism (and naive curiosity) is something else entirely. Seen through his eyes, a rundown corner of a Dublin graveyard is a figure for hope and hopelessness, mortality and dogged survival: "Mr Bloom walked unheeded along his grove by saddened angels, crosses, broken pillars, family vaults, stone hopes praying with upcast eyes, old Ireland's hearts and hands. More sensible to spend the money on some charity for the living. Pray for the repose of the soul of. Does anybody really?" --<i>James Marcus</i></p>The 1934 text, as corrected and reset in 1961. Ulysses is one of the most influential novels of the twentieth century. It was not easy to find a publisher in America willing to take it on, and when Jane Jeap and Margaret Anderson started printing extracts from the book their literary magazine The Little Review in 1918, they were arrested and charged with publishing obscenity. They were fined $100, and even The New York Times expressed satisfaction with their conviction. Ulysses was not published in book form until 1922, when another American woman, Sylvia Beach, published it in Paris for her Shakespeare &amp; Company. Ulysses was not available legally in any English-speaking country until 1934, when Random House successfully defended Joyce against obscenity charges and published it in the Modern Library. This edition follows the complete and unabridged text as corrected and reset in 1961. Judge John Woolsey's decision lifting the ban against Ulysses is reprinted, along with a letter from Joyce to Bennett Cerf, the publisher of Random House, and the original foreword to the book by Morris L. Ernst, who defended Ulysses during the trial.</p><h2>Emanuel CrunchTime Constitutional Law</h2><p><p>When it&#x2019;s exam time you need the right information in the right format to study efficiently and effectively. <strong>Emanuel�&nbsp;CrunchTime</strong> is the perfect tool for exam studying.

The present state-of-art has emphasized on the rich array of phenomena and represented in a simplest possible way. The use of thermal green functions has been annulled inspite of their fashionability and undeniable power in the hands of skilled theorist. The power of phenomenological theory has given detailed insight and microscopic theory is narrowly directed to the task of computing the coefficients in phenomenological equations. The fact that readers of this book belong to a broad spectrum of academic levels and professional scales. In this edition we made enormous efforts to make the content of this book as pleasant as possible for all of them. Researchers may use the book as a balanced literature of past and recent work in the field for developing new theoretical models, practical applications. Researchers and academicians in universities may use it to extend their teaching material whereas the students may use it for quick understanding of concepts and theoretical models about superconductivity. Special attention has given to keep the text simple and easy-to-understand but at the same time comprehensive and detailed. We aim to serve a wide range of readers groups with the intention of contributing towards technological advancement in the field of superconductivity. Introduction to Superconductivity tends to establish the journey from initial conceptualization of idea of superconductivity and major breakthroughs in the field to modern ongoing researches in plethora of domains towards building an advanced future. The book starts right from the origins of superconductivity phenomenon and goes on to relate different aspects in wide range of its applications.</p><p></p><h2>Teaching and Christian Imagination</h2><p>This book offers an energizing Christian vision for the art of teaching.

Enjoy natural vitality and superior sexuality through the breathing, movement and sound techniques of Reichian therapy and breathwork. Explore techniques developed by Wilhelm Reich to dissolve pent-up tensions, which he called armoring. Learn to loosen and dissolve the armoring to allow for the removal of tensions and the creation of new links between the body and mind. People learn to hold back basic needs and feelings which they have been taught to be inappropriate. An enormous amount of time and energy is spent suppressing these instincts, especially during childhood and traumatic events. Reich called the resulting blockages armoring. A most effective way to free blocked energies is through the breathing and movement techniques of Reichian therapy. Individual Reichian breathwork sessions are taught in this practical book. Anyone can improve their vitality, inspiration and passion through the breathing, movement and sound techniques of Reichian therapy revealed here. The pioneering therapist Wilhelm Reich developed these techniques in the early 20th century. He is commonly considered to be the grandfather of all deep emotional release forms of bodywork now practiced by medical doctors, chiropractors, and therapists around the world.

The book ranges across the whole of the continent during this crucial period, examining Jewish communities in all the major countries, describing everything from incrementalism in England to the impenetrable hostility to be found in Germany. The author describes pogroms, poverty, and migration, the image of the Jew as revolutionary, the rise of Zionism and the "Palestinian idea," and much more. Vital is particularly interested in the dynamics within the Jewish community, examining the clash between politically neutral traditionalists and a new group of activists, whose unprecedented demands for national and political self-determination were stimulated both by increasing civil emancipation and the mounting effort to drive the Jews out of Europe altogether. The book ends on a controversial note, with Vital suggesting that the fate of the Jewish people was to some degree their own doing; at times, by their own autonomous action and choice; at others, by inaction and default. <br> This powerful and stimulating new analysis represents a watershed in our understanding of the history of the Jews in Europe.</p><p>In 1744, at the height of the War of the Austrian Succession, Empress Maria Therese came to believe that the Jews of Prague were plotting against her, in league with Austria's Prussian enemies. She decided accordingly to expel every member of the city's long-established Jewish community--"a brutal sanction," Anglo-Israeli historian David Vital notes, that "would have put an entire population on to the roads of Europe to march through lands in which they were highly unlikely to be allowed to settle in search of one in which they might." Maria Therese relented eventually, but the Jews of her empire were reminded once again of their precarious position, always potential victims of a ruler's whim.<p> Half a century later, for the first time in European history, the Jews of France were accorded equal rights of citizenship in the wake of the revolution. From that time on, Vital writes in his encyclopedic history of Jews in early-modern Europe, secularism replaced the former hierarchy of ghetto leaders and rabbinical authority. Able to move more or less freely in the larger society, Jews no longer had to band together for protection, and in short order many of them played important roles in finance, government, and industry. Reaction to their rise was swift: with it came an increase in anti-Semitism and militant nationalism throughout Europe, opposition from both right and left. Their communities now weakened, Jews were ever more vulnerable to attacks by their enemies. These tendencies would culminate in Holocaust, a nightmare of history that, Vital shows, was decades in the making. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p><br>From 1977 to his retirement in 1995, <strong>David Vital</strong> was Nahum Goldmann Professor of Diplomacy at Tel Aviv University.

CFSC examines how the school, family, and community influence children&#39;s socialization. Roberta Berns uses Bronfenbrenner&#39;s Bioecological Model of Human Development as a framework. Courses for which CFSC is appropriate are often titled: Socialization of the Child; Child and Society, or Child in Society; Child, Family, and Community; or Child Development in the Family and Community. The course is frequently taken by future teachers, education paraprofessionals (e.g., child care workers), and psychology, sociology or human ecology majors. The course can be found in various departments, including Human/Child Development, Early Childhood Education; Child/Family Relations; Sociology; Psychology or Psychology/Social Behavior; Home Economics; Human or Social Ecology, and Teacher Education. The course is a requirement for California Early Childhood Education certification and is offered at most California community colleges.</p><p>Roberta Berns is a Professor Emerita at the University of California, Irvine, as well as Saddleback College, where she founded and chaired the Human Development Department.

His voice in the rafters.<br><br>James walking away. The old lady falling. There under the jaw of the roof. In the vault of the bed loft. Into the shadow of death. Pushed by James&#x2019;s will. By James&#x2019;s hand. By James&#x2019;s words: This is my day. You&#x2019;ll not fish today.<br>2<br><br>Still the old lady fished. If the reeds had dried up and the banks folded and crumbled down she would have fished still. If God had come into the valley, come holding out the long finger of salvation, moaning in the darkness, thundering down the gap at the lake head, skimming across the water, drying up the blue signature like blotting-paper, asking where, asking why, defying an answer, she would have thrown her line against the rebuke; she would have caught a piece of mud and looked it over; she would have drawn a line with the barb when the fire of righteousness baked the bottom.<br>3<br><br>Ara saw her fishing along the creek. Fishing shamelessly with bait. Fishing without a glance towards her daughter-in-law, who was hanging washing on the bushes near the rail fence.<br><br>I might as well be dead for all of her, Ara said.

There&#x2019;s only three of them. They can&#x2019;t eat all the fish she&#x2019;d catch.<br><br>William would try to explain, but he couldn&#x2019;t. He only felt, but he always felt he knew. He could give half a dozen reasons for anything. When a woman on his route flagged him down with a coat and asked him to bring back a spool of thread from the town below, he&#x2019;d explain that thread has a hundred uses. When it comes down to it, he&#x2019;d say, there&#x2019;s no telling what thread is for. I knew a woman once, he&#x2019;d say, who used it to sew up her man after he was throwed on a barbed-wire fence.<br><br>Ara could hear the cow mumbling dry grass by the bushes. There was no other sound.<br><br>The old lady was rounding the bend of the creek. She was throwing her line into a rock pool. She was fishing upstream to the source. That way she&#x2019;d come to the bones of the hills and the flats between where the herd cows ranged. They&#x2019;d turn their tails to her and stretch their hides tight. They&#x2019;d turn their living flesh from her as she&#x2019;d turned hers from others.<br><br>The water was running low in the creek. Except in the pools, it would be hardly up to the ankle. Yet as she watched the old lady, Ara felt death leaking through from the centre of the earth. Death rising to the knee. Death rising to the loin.<br><br>She raised her chin to unseat the thought. No such thing could happen. The water was drying away. It lay only in the deep pools.<br>Ara wasn&#x2019;t sure where water started.<br><br>William wouldn&#x2019;t hesitate: It comes gurgling up from inside the hill over beyond the lake. There&#x2019;s water over and it falls down. There&#x2019;s water under and it rushes up. The trouble with water is it never rushes at the right time. The creeks dry up and the grass with them. There are men, he&#x2019;d say, have seen their whole place fade like a cheap shirt. And there&#x2019;s no way a man can fold it up and bring it in out of the sun. You can save a cabbage plant or a tomato plant with tents of paper if you&#x2019;ve got the paper, but there&#x2019;s no human being living can tent a field and pasture.<br><br>I&#x2019;ve seen cows, he&#x2019;d say, with lard running off them into the ground. The most unaccountable thing, he&#x2019;d say, is the way the sun falls. I&#x2019;ve seen a great cow, he&#x2019;d say, throw no more shadow for its calf than a lean rabbit.<br>Ara looked over the fence. There was no one on the road. It lay white across the burnt grass.<br><br>Coyote made the land his pastime. He stretched out his paw. He breathed on the grass. His spittle eyed it with prickly pear.<br><br>Ara went into the house. She filled the basin at the pump in the kitchen and cooled her feet in the water.<br><br>We&#x2019;ve never had a pump in our house all the years we&#x2019;ve lived here, she&#x2019;d heard Greta say. Someday, she&#x2019;d say, you&#x2019;ll lift the handle and stand waiting till eternity. James brings water in barrels from the spring. The thing about a barrel is you take it where you take it. There&#x2019;s something fixed about a pump, fixed and uncertain.<br>Ara went to the door. She threw the water from the basin into the dust. She watched the water roll in balls on the ground. Roll and divide and spin.<br><br>The old lady had disappeared.<br><br>Ara put on a straw hat. She tied it with a bootlace under the chin. She wiped the top of the table with her apron which she threw behind a pile of papers in the corner. She went to the fence and leaned against the rails.<br><br>If a man lost the road in the land round William Potter&#x2019;s, he couldn&#x2019;t find his way by keeping to the creek bottom for the creek flowed this way and that at the land&#x2019;s whim. The earth fell away in hills and clefts as if it had been dropped carelessly wrinkled on the bare floor of the world.<br><br>Even God&#x2019;s eye could not spy out the men lost here already, Ara thought. He had looked mercifully on the people of Nineveh though they did not know their right hand and their left. But there were not enough people here to attract his attention. The cattle were scrub cattle. The men lay like sift in the cracks of the earth.<br><br>Standing against the rails of the fence, she looked out over the yellow grass. The empty road leading from James&#x2019;s gate went on from William&#x2019;s past the streaked hills, past the Wagners&#x2019;, down over the culvert, past Felix Prosper&#x2019;s.</p><h2>The Ged For Dummies, 2E</h2><p><p>Get the skills and know-how you need to pass the GED test</p> <p>Earning a GED can provide you with an advantage over other job and education candidates and the confidence to take the next step. <i>The GED For Dummies, 2nd Edition</i> gives you fresh and relevant example questions from the GED and even more hands-on training in each of the 5 subject areas to help you maximize your success and earn a passing score.</p> <ul> <li>Features 2 full practice tests in each of the 5 subject areas with detailed walk-throughs and explanations for every solution</li> <li>Offers advice on test preparation, from registering and studying effectively to managing your time during the exam</li> </ul> <p>Improve your job and education prospects now by studying for the GED with this easy-to-follow, proven guide!</p></p><p><b>Get the skills, information, and techniques you need to earn your high school equivalency</b> <p>In today's job environment, earning a GED can give you an edge over the competition &#x2014; whether it's to find a new job or to advance in the one you already have.

The collaborative effort of more than 30 major U.S. and Canadian botanical institutions, it revises and synthesizes literally thousands of floristic monographs and regional floras published over the last three centuries. But more than that, it distills the original herbarium, laboratory, and field work of hundreds of contributors--all of them leading botanists and taxonomic authorities who have joined forces to develop this century's premier tool for identifying, understanding, and conserving North America's priceless floristic heritage. Concise, easy to use, and beautifully bound and illustrated, <em>Flora of North America</em> is an indispensable working resource for botanists, conservationists, ecologists, agronomists, foresters, range and land managers, horticulturists,--anyone with a serious interest in the distribution, habitat, morphology, and survival of the wide-ranging plant life around us. Each of its taxonomic volumes brings together the full spectrum of critical botanical data, from basic descriptions to chromosome numbers. The entries also correct erroneous information, qualify misapplied variant names, and note known hybridizations. Findings derived from recent experimental work and from numerical taxonomy are incorporated, and to assure accuracy, these data have been extensively reviewed and tested by cooperating taxonomic specialists. Volume 1 consists of a series of introductory essays by nearly two dozen noted botanical authorities. Among the topics covered are the transformation of North American plant life since the end of the Mesozoic era some 70 million years ago; the influence of geographic, climatic, and soil factors; the impact of human cultivation; great naturalists and their contributions to botany and floristics since the age of Columbus; and approaches to plant classification, with particular attention to the evolutionarily unique pteridophytes and gymnosperms that are covered in Volume 2.<br></p><p>The Editorial Committee of the Flora of North America (FNA) is responsible for the authoritative, multivolume work describing the native plants of North America.<br>"A massive ten-year effort, coordinated by the Missouri Botanical Gardens and involving the collaboration of American and Canadian botanical taxonomists and institutions, finally bears fruit with the simultaneous publication of the first two volumes of a projected 14-volume catalog....Although regional field guides and floras with local range maps and photographs will continue to flourish, these handsomely bound and typeset volumes identifying and detailing the complete continental flora north of Mexico will be the definitive work well into the next century.

Few fields of human endeavor have inspired so many memorable anecdotes as warfare, from the Bible and Livy through Gibbon and Froissart, to the imperial wars of the nineteenth century and the world conflicts of the twentieth.<br><br>This collection of is principally concerned with American and British conflicts, with, as the author says, "occasional forays among the ranks of foreign armies"--notably the Greeks, the Romans, and Napoleon's veterans. Hastings has sought stories that illustrate the military condition through the ages, both on the battlefield and in barracks: comic, eccentric, heroic, tragic. Here are Caesar at the Rubicon and the revolt of the Praetorian Guard; Alexander's horse and Prince Rupert's dog; the legendary Mother Ross enlisting in search of her lost husband in 1693; Evelyn Waugh as the least plausible of commandos; General Douglas MacArthur's good luck charm "Charlie," a lump of lava rock carved into a Hawaiian warrior; and much more. Some of the stories will be familiar to students of military history while others are less well known, but all provide fascinating sidelights to history.<br><br>"An outstanding book...in a class by itself. It's a work of literature. One can't simply browse: The quality of the writing casts the spell of poetry.

His most recent books include Bomber Command, Battle for the Falklands, and Overlord.<br>Works of this kind draw their credibility from their editor. Hastings is familiar with the literature, sensitive to English prose, and aware of a good story. His use of narrative quality as the basic criterion for inclusion results in a pastiche of original accounts and secondary material from familiar sourcesthe Bible, Voltaire, Gibbon, and, occasionally, Hastings. The ancient and medieval anecdotes are a bit shopworn. The modern ones are so ethnocentric that Oxford might have published a book of British military anecdotes. Within these limits however, Hastings succeeds in illustrating the soldier's experience in both universal and specific aspects. Dennis E.

At the center of the industry is Upper Deck, the largest manufacturer, with sales of over $260 million each year. Williams exposes how the power brokers in the game of baseball have changed this once-innocent hobby forever. <br><br>Published in 1995 when Williams was a writer and columnist for <i>USA Today Baseball Weekly</i>, Card Sharks has been frequently cited by other authors and remains the definitive investigative look into the trading card business.</p><p>Sports cards were invented in the 1880s when tobacco tycoon James Buchanan Duke thought of putting a piece of cardboard in cigarette packs to prevent them from getting crushed in shipping. The cards served as free advertising space and premiums to boost sales.<br><br>Things have changed in 110 years. No longer a premium for another product, sports cards <i>are</i> the product. And a hot one at that. More than 10 million Americans collect sports cards, hoping one day to reap their "investment" benefits. How has the sports card industry, specifically the baseball card market, become a billion-dollar business in the past five years?<br><br>Pete Williams, who has covered major league baseball and sports memorabilia for <i>USA Today Baseball Weekly</i> since 1991, has the perfect vantage point on what's caused this explosive success in the shaky and shady world of sports cards. His gripping narrative takes us from the birth of trading cards to the present, when the buying and selling of cards has become everyman's stock market. At the center of the industry is the Upper Deck Company. Once a one-man shop in Anaheim, California, it has grown into the largest manufacturer of sports cards, with sales of 1 billion since 1990. Along the way, Upper Deck has revolutionized the trading card business by introducing a stunning array of wildly designed cards with incredible action photos, ultraviolet coating, and holograms to prevent counterfeiting. Williams's account is the first solid investigative look at what goes on at Upper Deck and he reveals the tactics its owners use to dominate the trading card market.<br><br>This book is a fascinating investigation of yet another facet of sports that has lost its innocence at the hands of greedy power brokers. But it's not just a story about sports; it's an absorbing tale about business, the costs of always going for the quick buck, and the way commercialism has seeped into every part of our society. <i>Card Sharks</i> will have you marveling at what this once-simple child's hobby has become.A white limousine drove up Pennsylvania Avenue past the White House. Upper Deck president Richard McWilliam leaned over his female companion and pointed at the Oval Office. It was there, he told her, that he and Reggie Jackson had met George Bush...Reggie had put in a call to the White House, and just like that, they were in the Oval Office. Reggie and Bush talked politics. Then he and Reggie gave the ex-president-to-be some Upper Deck baseball cards. Bush said he would share the cards with his grandchildren. "It was way cool," McWilliam told his companion.<br><br>McWilliam had invested $2.4 million in cash and letters of credit in the startup of the Upper Deck Company. He wasn't involved at the very beginning, but by 1993 it was all his show. In five years, he had made over $50 million in salary, dividends, and bonuses from Upper Deck. His 27 percent stake in the company was probably worth $70 million. Most important, he was in control. Bill Hemrick, whose Upper Deck card shop had been the inspiration for the company, was gone, although he retained 4.2 percent of company stock. Paul Sumner, who had come up with the idea of making a better baseball card, owned 14.6 percent of the company, but he had limited involvement in Upper Deck. Very limited. McWilliam, a thirty-nine-year-old accountant-turned-entrepreneur was single and had Hall-of-Famer Reggie Jackson as his best friend. McWilliam's company produced the most popular sports cards in the world and was worth, by his estimate, $250 million. He had even appeared on <i>The Sporting News'</i> annual list of the 100 most powerful people in sports. Funny how life had worked out for a guy who was never much of a sports fan.</p><h2>A History of Chinese Philosophy, Vol. 2: The Period of Classical Learning (From the Second Century B.C. to the Twentieth Century A.D.)</h2><p><p>Since its original publication in Chinese in the 1930s, this work has been accepted by Chinese scholars as the most important contribution to the study of their country's philosophy.

Although she had confessed to committing a long list of <i>maleficia</i> (deeds of harmful magic), including killing forty&#x2014;one infants and two mothers in labor, her evil career allegedly began with just one heinous act&#x2014;sex with a demon. Fornication with demons was a major theme of her trial record, which detailed an almost continuous orgy of sexual excess with her diabolical paramour Federlin "in many divers places, . . . even in the street by night."<br> <br> As Walter Stephens demonstrates in <i>Demon Lovers,</i> it was not Hausm�nnin or other so-called witches who were obsessive about sex with demons&#x2014;instead, a number of devout Christians, including trained theologians, displayed an uncanny preoccupation with the topic during the centuries of the "witch craze." Why? To find out, Stephens conducts a detailed investigation of the first and most influential treatises on witchcraft (written between 1430 and 1530), including the infamous <i>Malleus Maleficarum</i> (<i>Hammer of Witches</i>).<br> <br> Far from being credulous fools or mindless misogynists, early writers on witchcraft emerge in Stephens's account as rational but reluctant skeptics, trying desperately to resolve contradictions in Christian thought on God, spirits, and sacraments that had bedeviled theologians for centuries. Proof of the physical existence of demons&#x2014;for instance, through evidence of their intercourse with mortal witches&#x2014;would provide strong evidence for the reality of the supernatural, the truth of the Bible, and the existence of God. Early modern witchcraft theory reflected a crisis of belief&#x2014;a crisis that continues to be expressed today in popular debates over angels, Satanic ritual child abuse, and alien abduction.<br></p></p><p><b>Walter Stephens</b> is the Charles S.

Bailey <i>Speculum</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;The book is valuable not only because of its focus on witchcraft theoreticians and witchcraft in a theological context, but also because Stephens focuses on influential, but little-studied, early thinkers. . . .

As I look around at today's programmers, I can see what a large, beneficial effect that work has had. --Richard Mateosian, IEEE Micro<br><br>The Psychology of Computer Programming . . . was the first major book to address programming as an individual and team effort, and became a classic in the field. . . . Despite, or perhaps even because of, the perspective of 1971, this book remains a must-read for all software development managers. --J.J. Hirschfelder, Computing Reviews<br><br>Whether you're part of the generation of the 1960's and 1970's, or part of the current generation . . . you owe it to yourself to pick up a copy of this wonderful book. Once you've digested it, you should then track down all [twenty] of the other Weinberg textbooks published by Dorset House. . . . Every one of them is a jewel. --Ed Yourdon, Cutter IT E-Mail Advisor</p><h2>Juliet the Maniac: A Novel</h2><p><b>"Dazzling..."&#x2014;<i>The New York Times</i></b> <b><br></b> <br><b>Voted MOST ANTICIPATED NOVEL of 2019 by both Bustle and Nylon</b> <br><br><b>This portrait of a young teenager's fight toward understanding and recovering from mental illness is shockingly honest<b>, funny, and heartfelt. </b></b> <b><b><br></b></b> <br> A highly anticipated debut&#x2014;from a writer hailed as "a combination of Denis Johnson and Joan Didion" (<i>Dazed</i>)&#x2014;brilliantly captures the intimate triumph of a girl's struggle to become the woman she knows she can be.<br><br>Ambitious, talented fourteen-year-old honors student Juliet is poised for success at her Southern California high school.

She lives in West Virginia with her husband, the writer Scott McClanahan.<b>WHY I&#x2019;M SCARED OF BIRDS</b><p>I always took a shortcut through a vacant field. It had been undeveloped for years, a blank square behind the mall at the top of the hill, before you got to the stucco apartments. Once the plants in it had been green and pretty, tall grass with bushes and wildflowers. It didn&#x2019;t look like that anymore. Everything had turned chalky and gray. The dead grass crinkled when I stepped on it. At the far end of the field, there was a whole flock of crows, dozens of black marks like a pox.</p><p>I expected them to fly away as I got closer, but they didn&#x2019;t move. They were black, black, black all over, claws to beak, and I felt their black-bead eyes following me.</p><p>I decided to sit down in the dirt, try to get the shadows to go away by willing myself solid and impassive like a tree. But the shadows caught up with me, and there were more of them now, shifting from shapes into pieces of people. Disembodied limbs, screeching mouths, long rotted hair. Ghosts. Wanting something from me, for me to do something, as if I could break their suffering and deliver them to heaven. They were saying something but all talking at once, and I couldn&#x2019;t make out what they said. The crows were still watching me. They began to caw. They were all trying to tell me something. They were all trying to tell me what to do. The sun shone through the thick clouds, a yellow blob in the sky.</p><p>My heart beat faster, faster until it was just one long thrum. The molecules around my head buzzed, the crows cackled, the shadows clung at me, and all of it was cloaked in doom. The poison in me was spreading, burning like bile in my veins, dismantling cells and becoming contagious. It would spread into my parents, into Nicole. The only way to get the evil out, to exorcise the ghosts, was to choke it. To choke myself. It was the only way. I stood up and it began pouring rain.</p><p>When I got home, I was soaked. My parents were getting ready to leave for dinner. They seemed surprised to see me, surprised that I was soaking wet. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t know it was raining,&#x201d; my dad said.</p><p>A new Mexican restaurant had opened up near the gas station. &#x201c;Do you want to come?&#x201d; my mom asked. I told her no. &#x201c;Are you OK? You look sick,&#x201d; she said. I said I was fine. I was just tired, I was just cold and wet. I said I would take a hot shower. They left.</p><p>The Other Thing took over, pushing me into the bathroom. I watched my hand take out my medicine&#x2014;Tegretol, Wellbutrin. The pills poured onto the counter in a neat pile. It didn&#x2019;t seem like enough. I walked into the kitchen, the tiny cupboard where my mom kept the vitamins and headache medicine. There was a big bottle of Tylenol from Costco. There was a smaller bottle of Benadryl too. I set both of them down on the counter. I grabbed one of the kitchen chairs. I dragged it in front of the fridge. There was a bunch of liquor bottles on top. I grabbed the gin. I stepped down, got a tall glass. I poured the gin into it until it was full. I didn&#x2019;t put the bottle back. I took the glass and the pill bottles and went into the bathroom. I poured the Tylenol and Benadryl out next to the other pills, threw all of the bottles in the trash. They looked pretty&#x2014;the white of the Tylenol and Tegretol mixed with the bright pink and red of the other pills. I grabbed a handful, shoved them in my mouth, swallowed them with the gin, until it was all gone. They went down my throat so easy it was like they belonged there.</p><p>I went into my bedroom. The lights were off and the room was very dark. I lay down on the bed. My eyelids grew heavy and I closed them. Everything felt thick and dumb. I think I fell asleep. I dreamt I was tied, my hands behind my back, my feet together. Someone had lit me on fire. The flame that burned me was very white and very hot, but it didn&#x2019;t hurt. I couldn&#x2019;t see anything else but flames. I lost place of my body. I became the fire.</p><p>And then my dad was shaking me. I opened my eyes and the fire was gone. He was sitting on the bed, over me. It looked like there were three of him. My mother was over his shoulder. There were three of her too. Her face glistened, I think she was crying, and the tears glowed, brilliant as stars.</p><p>The next thing I knew, I was in the car. My mother was in the backseat with me. My face was against the window, the glass cool on my cheek. She kept on saying my name over and over, her hand grabbing my arm. It seemed too difficult to answer her and so I didn&#x2019;t. We were on the freeway and the other car lights went by in streaks and blurs, like lines of fire.</p></p><h2>The Warrior and the Priest: Woodrow Wilson and Theodore Roosevelt</h2><p><p>The colossal figures who shaped the politics of industrial America emerge in full scale in this engrossing comparative biography. In both the depth and sophistication of intellect that they brought to politics and in the titanic conflict they waged with each other, Roosevelt and Wilson were, like Hamilton and Jefferson before them, the political architects for an entire century.</p><p>All previous efforts to treat the philosophies and programs of Roosevelt&#x2019;s New Nationalism and Wilson&#x2019;s New Freedom have been partial and episodic. Now John Milton Cooper reconstructs in parallel lines the entire range of their ideologies and their struggles&#x2015;their social identification in terms of class, education, and regional roots; the origins and evolution of their political thought; their party leadership roles; and their psychological characters.</p><p>After tracking the shared identities of young manhood, Cooper explains the conflict of their mature years that developed from opposing philosophies of government. Not until 1912, when Wilson ran for president, did they come together partially and briefly on common practical grounds of reform of the political process and efforts to curb big business in the public interest. Later, foreign policy in particular pitted them in a deeper conflict that consumed the rest of their lives.</p></p><p>Cooper is E. Gordon Fox Professor of American Institutions at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.&#x201c;An engrossing study... Mr. Cooper is at ease with his subjects and at home in their period, and he puts his learning at our disposal in a clear, active, engaging style.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>The New Yorker</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;[Cooper&#x2019;s] book displays the trained historical mind at close to its professional best.

M. Montgomery, all of which are related to the Anne of Green Gables series. It features a abundance of stories set in or about the fictional Canadian village of Avonlea. Chronicles of Avonlea was followed, in 1920, by Further Chronicles of Avonlea, which also dealt with numerous families from the Avonlea district.</p><p>On Prince Edward Island, where Anne Shirley grew up in the sea-sprayed town of Avonlea, there was no shortage of wonderful stories. There was the case of Ludovic Speed, who wouldn&#39;t propose to the woman he had courted for fifteen years until Anne devised a plan to &#34;speed&#34; him up . . . if it didn&#39;t backfire and break his heart. But no one could blame mischievous Anne for the hilarious battle of the sexes that erupted when a man-hating woman and her cat got quarantined in the same house with a woman-hating bachelor and his dog. From sprawling Penhallow Grange, where a family waits nearly forever for two quarreling lovers to break their stubborn silence, to the tumbledown farm of Old Man Shaw, who awaits the return of his beloved daughter, L. M. Montgomery has written twelve tales of secret hopes and hidden dreams, filled with enchantment and humor.Lucy Maud Montgomery (November 30, 1874 &#x2013; April 24, 1942) published as L.M. Montgomery, was a Canadian author best known for a series of novels beginning in 1908 with Anne of Green Gables. The book was an immediate success. The central character, Anne Shirley, an orphaned girl, made Montgomery famous in her lifetime and gave her an international following. The first novel was followed by a series of sequels with Anne as the central character. Montgomery went on to publish 20 novels as well as 530 short stories, 500 poems, and 30 essays.</p><h2>Lolita</h2><p>A STORY OF AN OLD MAN,FALLING IN LOVE WITH A 12-13 YEAR OLD GIRL,WHICH HER MOTHER WAS KILLED BY HIM. A PAPERBACK. 319 PAGES</p><p>Despite its lascivious reputation, the pleasures of <i>Lolita</i> are as much intellectual as erogenous. It is a love story with the power to raise both chuckles and eyebrows. Humbert Humbert is a European intellectual adrift in America, haunted by memories of a lost adolescent love. When he meets his ideal nymphet in the shape of 12-year-old Dolores Haze, he constructs an elaborate plot to seduce her, but first he must get rid of her mother. In spite of his diabolical wit, reality proves to be more slippery than Humbert's feverish fantasies, and Lolita refuses to conform to his image of the perfect lover.<p> Playfully perverse in form as well as content, riddled with puns and literary allusions, Nabokov's 1955 novel is a hymn to the Russian-born author's delight in his adopted language. Indeed, readers who want to probe all of its allusive nooks and crannies will need to consult the annotated edition. <i>Lolita</i> is undoubtedly, brazenly erotic, but the eroticism springs less from the "frail honey-hued shoulders ... the silky supple bare back" of little Lo than it does from the wantonly gorgeous prose that Humbert uses to recount his forbidden passion: </p><blockquote> She was musical and apple-sweet ... Lola the bobby-soxer, devouring her immemorial fruit, singing through its juice ... and every movement she made, every shuffle and ripple, helped me to conceal and to improve the secret system of tactile correspondence between beast and beauty--between my gagged, bursting beast and the beauty of her dimpled body in its innocent cotton frock. </blockquote> Much has been made of <i>Lolita</i> as metaphor, perhaps because the love affair at its heart is so troubling. Humbert represents the formal, educated Old World of Europe, while Lolita is America: ripening, beautiful, but not too bright and a little vulgar. Nabokov delights in exploring the intercourse between these cultures, and the passages where Humbert describes the suburbs and strip malls and motels of postwar America are filled with both attraction and repulsion, "those restaurants where the holy spirit of Huncan Dines had descended upon the cute paper napkins and cottage-cheese-crested salads." Yet however tempting the novel's symbolism may be, its chief delight--and power--lies in the character of Humbert Humbert. He, at least as he tells it, is no seedy skulker, no twisted destroyer of innocence. Instead, Nabokov's celebrated mouthpiece is erudite and witty, even at his most depraved. Humbert can't help it--linguistic <i>jouissance</i> is as important to him as the satisfaction of his arrested libido. <i>--Simon Leake</i>Critics are just beginning to hail Jeremy Irons' performance for Random House AudioBooks...<p><b>"a road trip to hell in a luxury sedan." </b><br>--Salon Magazine</p><p><b>"In his reading Irons recreates the clarity, precision, and lilt of every glorious sentence." </b><br>--The Washington Post</p><p><b>"Nabokov said Lolita was the record of his love affair with the English language; Irons makes it a menage a trois." </b><br>-- Vogue</p><p><b>"[Irons's] efforts have placed this superb audio on my life list, to be saved for repeated listening."</b><br>--Boston Globe</p><p>" . . . most praiseworthy of all the audio efforts I've heard . . ."<br>-- Men's Journal</p><p><b>"Irons' inspired reading is not to be missed."</b><br> -- Chicago Tribune</p><p><b>"...a beautifully produced recording that pushes the boundaries of the audio medium.<br> . . . hands down the best audio production of the year." </b><br>-- Library Journal</p><p><b>"Irons reads with wickedly understated malevolence, preserving Humbert's foolish patrician airs.

There have been many books written about the life and accomplishments of the Zionist icon and founder of modern Israel, but this new biography by eminent Israeli historian Anita Shapira strives to get to the core of the complex man who would become the face of the new Jewish nation. Shapira tells the Ben-Gurion story anew, focusing especially on the period after 1948, during the first years of statehood. As a result of her extensive research and singular access to Ben-Gurion&#x2019;s personal archives, the author provides fascinating and original insights into his personal qualities and those that defined his political leadership. As Shapira writes, &#x201c;Ben-Gurion liked to argue that history is made by the masses, not individuals. But just as Lenin brought the Bolshevik Revolution into the world and Churchill delivered a fighting Britain, so with Ben-Gurion and the Jewish state. He knew how to create and exploit the circumstances that made its birth possible.&#x201d; Shapira&#x2019;s portrait reveals the flesh-and-blood man who more than anyone else realized the Israeli state.</p><p><b>Anita Shapira </b>is professor emerita at Tel Aviv University, where she previously served as dean of the Faculty of Humanities and held the Ruben Merenfeld Chair for the Study of Zionism.

Yet, as this landmark new book reveals, that estate also gave rise to one of the most fascinating and provocative experiments in American cultural history: the Taliesin Fellowship, an extraordinary architectural colony where Wright trained hundreds of devoted apprentices, while using them as the de facto architectural practice where all of his late masterpieces&#x2014;Fallingwater, Johnson Wax, the Guggenheim Museum&#x2014;were born.</p><p> A decade in the making, <em>The Fellowship </em>draws on hundreds of new and unpublished interviews, along with countless unseen documents from the Wright archives, to create a captivating portrait of Taliesin and the three mercurial figures at its center: Wright, his imperious wife Olgivanna Hinzenberg, and her spiritual master, the Greek-Armenian mystic Georgi Gurdjieff. Authors Roger Friedland and Harold Zellman reveal how the idealistic community of Taliesin became a kind of fiefdom, where young apprentices were both inspired and manipulated by the architect and his wife. They trace the decades-long war of wills between Wright and Olgivanna, in which organic architecture was pitted against esoteric spiritualism in a struggle for the soul of Taliesin. They chronicle Wright's perennial battles with clients, bankers, and the government, which suspected him of both communist and fascist sympathies. And through it all they tell the stories of Wright's devoted apprentices&#x2014;many of them gay men&#x2014;who found an uncertain refuge in the architect&#x2019;s Wisconsin and Arizona compounds, and who helped the master realize his dreamlike architectural visions, often at great personal cost. </p><p>Epic in scope yet intimate in its detail, <em>The Fellowship</em> is an unforgettable story of genius and ego, sex and violence, mysticism and utopianism&#x2014;a magisterial work of biography that will forever change how we think about Frank Lloyd Wright and his world.</p></p><p><p>Roger Friedland is a cultural sociologist who studies love, sex, and God.

It is dominated by "Mr. Sam," the single greatest figure in the history of the liquor business, the man who made drinking whiskey respectable in the United States and who in the 1950s and 1960s built Seagram into the first worldwide empire in wine and spirits.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Sam's death in 1971, his oldest son, Edgar, maintained the business, though he was distracted by his matrimonial problems. Nevertheless, in the 1980s he masterminded a major coup when he translated a small investment in oil made by his father into a 25 percent stake in the mighty DuPont company. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But in the 1990s, Edgar allowed his second son, Edgar Jr., to indulge his ambition to become a media tycoon. The stake in DuPont was sold, and the money reinvested in Universal, the film and theme-park empire. Edgar Jr. then paid more than $10 billion to buy Polygram Records and thus fulfill his fancy to be king of the world's music business. But at the same time, he remained in charge of the liquor business, which started to stagnate--indeed, to fall apart. Then came the final disaster when the increasingly divided family sold out to Jean-Marie Messier, overreaching empire builder of Vivendi, the French conglomerate.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the story of this amazing family over the past century is about more than booze and business. <i>The Bronfmans </i>is a spectacular account that details the larger-than-life personalities and bitter rivalries that have made the family so famous and, sometimes, so infamous.</p><p>Nicholas Faith is a distinguished veteran journalist, a former senior editor at <i>The Economist</i> and the London<i> Sunday Times</i>. He also founded and was chairman of the International Spirits Challenge, now the most prestigious event of its kind in the world. He has written twenty-three books, including <i>The Winemakers of Bordeaux</i> and <i>Safety in Numbers: The Mysterious World of Swiss Banking.</i>Bronfmans<br><i>One</i>MR. SAM, NO ORDINARY MONSTERWHEN I TOLD FRIENDS THAT I HAD BEEN COMMISSIONED TO WRITE ABOUT the Bronfman family, many of them muttered about "cement galoshes" and one serious citizen--a leading investment banker--warned me that the Bronfman family would infallibly take out a contract on me. Although this has turned into something of a joke between us, I found that until recently the threat could have been very real. One of his many mistresses had rebuked Edgar, the founder's elder son, when he talked of "knee-capping" someone. He retorted simply, "No, I meant it." And in the 1980s Edgar's son Edgar Jr. told an obstructive television producer that "in my grandfather's time we'd have killed you." Naturally these comments did nothing to dispel the continuing atmosphere of threat and mystery that still surrounds the family and obviously further whetted my appetite for writing a book about this extraordinary dynasty. Such stories still fascinate people several years after the Bronfmans have sold Seagram, the family firm, to Jean-Marie Messier, the French mogul widely viewed as "megalomaniacal" in his overweening empire building and self-aggrandizement, and the name has disappeared from the business scene. Clearly the Bronfman name, and the story behind it, has not lost its capacity to intrigue, and even frighten, the most sophisticated of onlookers.The attraction is partly based on the family's wealth. This is still considerable. Even after the disaster of the sale to Messier the combined wealth of Mr. Sam's two sons, Edgar and Charles, amounts to over $5 billion, and there are probably several billions more in the hands of the rest of thisenormous tribe. But even more important is the reputation of the founder, Sam Bronfman, as "the last bootlegger," the one who went legit so successfully. For the story involves a double fascination, that of the billionaire businessman, combined with the mystery inevitably attached to any survivor of that enormous business, the supply of liquor to the American people during Prohibition. The description "bootlegger" haunted him--and his children and grandchildren--for seventy years after Repeal. One evening his youngest child, Charles, asked him in all innocence, "Daddy, what's a bootlegger?" Mr. Sam dropped the carving knife and said angrily, "Don't you ever say that word again." As late as 2000, sixty-seven years after Repeal, Messier could refer to the family's "bootlegger methods." Yet Mr. Sam, as he was usually called, believed that the mere fact that liquor was illegal in the United States was irrelevant because he felt, with some reason, that he was involved in a legal business, distilling liquor in Canada and exporting it to the US. So he was naturally upset that his trade turned him into a bootlegger and spent his life in an obsessive, and largely unsuccessful, attempt to gain respectability and the respect he felt, rightly, was his due.This is not surprising, for in reality he was an authentic business genius, undoubtedly the greatest in the long history of hard liquor, indeed the man who really invented the whole industry in the US by exploiting the post-Repeal thirst for decent whiskey and made drinking hard liquor respectable for the first time in American history. He was a major creative force who understood that the key to lasting success was reliable quality, which for him implied blending well-aged spirits. That perception, reinforced by an obsessive perfectionism, proved to be in line with the willingness of ordinary Americans to respond to spirits which were not mere rot-gut.While this book is about the rise and fall of a dynastic business, the family was so numerous, so widespread, the story of its members so complex, that I have simply not been able to write about the vast majority of the family--Sam's three brothers and four sisters produced innumerable progeny and, over a century, have multiplied into a considerable tribe. So I have had to confine myself to Mr. Sam, his offspring, and, of the third generation, only Sam and Edgar Jr., the sons of his elder son, Edgar.But even within this apparently limited remit, the story is far more important and more widely relevant than that of a single family who escaped from the frozen poverty of the Canadian prairies to generate immensewealth within a few decades of their arrival from czarist Russia, or of a liquor company, however important, and a single individual, however gifted and fascinating. For the Bronfman saga also involves other, very different worlds, notably those of Hollywood and of the higher reaches of the French business aristocracy.It also, and perhaps most importantly, shines a powerful spotlight on the fundamental changes in the mindset of the world Jewish community in the course of the twentieth century. Even in the face of the Holocaust, the normally dictatorial Sam, for thirty years the uncrowned leader of the Jewish community in Canada, could never summon up the courage to mount an open challenge to gentile politicians, for he perceived them as fundamentally unchallengeable--an attitude typical of Jewish leaders throughout the world. By the sharpest of contrasts, his elder son Edgar, as the long-serving president of the previously almost completely powerless World Jewish Congress, was able to mount repeated challenges to the most powerful enemies of world Jewry--like Swiss bankers and Kurt Waldheim, previously the secretary-general of the United Nations. He was even bold enough to criticize the leaders of Israel, a group accustomed to treat their brethren scattered throughout the world as what Lenin described as "useful idiots," cash cows without any right to a voice, especially so far as Israel was concerned.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The Bronfman saga starts in the 1890s in the bleak plains of Saskatchewan and ends just over a century later with a disastrous agreement reached in the gilded salons of a French conglomerate. In less than a century Seagram, their family company, first rose to become a dominant force in the world market for spirits, was becalmed for a generation, and then thrown to the wolves in the person of Jean-Marie Messier of Vivendi. The founder had repeatedly warned his children of the oft-repeated motto "shirtsleeves to shirtsleeves in three generations." Whether the fear was genuine, or whether it was simply that he knew that he wouldn't be there to control the activities of the third generation, is open to question.After a poverty-stricken few years the family established itself as hoteliers, and then, after 1920, started to supply liquor across the forty-ninth parallel into a newly dry United States. Subsequently, as distillers as well as merchants, they continued to supply their thirsty neighbors until 1933, but they became truly, seriously, rich only in the 1930s and 1940s thanks to Mr.Sam's whiskies, most obviously 7 Crown. Mr. Sam then went on to pioneer, albeit more by chance than deliberate strategy, the totally original concept of a worldwide business producing and selling a wide range of wines and spirits from a dozen different countries. As a result, before Mr. Sam died in 1971 Seagram had become by far the biggest group in the world liquor business and remained a major, albeit declining, force over the following thirty years before its swift demise at the hands of Messier in 2000.The continuing fascination of the--largely mythical--Mr. Sam begs an important question: why the myth was not attached to other former bootleggers like Harry Hatch of Hiram Walker, famous for brands like Canadian Club and Mr. Sam's great rival in the 1920s, or the appalling Lew Rosenstiel of Schenley Distillers, his archenemy in the United States after Prohibition. But perhaps the most telling contrast is with Joseph Kennedy, in every way a far more disreputable character than Sam Bronfman. While Bronfman was tarred through his associations with bootleggers, Kennedy's far closer relationships lasted long enough for them to be put to good use in ensuring that Illinois voted for his son John in the 1960 presidential elections.The contrast comes over most clearly in the way Bronfman and Kennedy were regarded by the mighty Distillers Company Limited, universally known as the DCL, which dominated the Scotch business. The hardheaded directors happily went into partnership with Mr. Sam, whom they regarded as an honest fellow with an excellent knowledge of whiskey, but felt, wrote Ronald Weir1 in the official history of the company, that "Kennedy was difficult to deal with, signing contracts and immediately challenging their interpretation" and expressing himself in language at least as strong as that employed by Mr. Sam. And whereas Bronfman was totally faithful to his beloved wife, Kennedy was the most notorious of sexual athletes--and it would have been unthinkable for Sam to have allowed his daughter to be lobotomized as did Joe Kennedy.Although Mr. Sam was deeply ashamed of his continuing association with his activities during Prohibition he did nothing to discourage the myths that surrounded his persona. In 1970, the year before he died, he was confronted with the proofs of the official history of Seagram. "This is so much bullshit," he exploded. "If I only told the truth I'd sell ten million copies." The remark has obviously encouraged the notion that he--and the rest of the family--had committed many an evil deed, but probably had more to do with his relentless egomania, the assumption that any storystarring him would be of enormous interest to the whole world. I can only hope so.The flames of speculation have been fed by the fate of attempts by the family to provide an authorized account of their story. Towards the end of Mr. Sam's life the Canadian journalist Terence Robertson attempted to write a biography of Mr. Sam, which was never published but exists in manuscript form.2 It is based on a number of conversations with Mr. Sam and so can be taken to reflect his own version of events. For Mr. Sam, as is the way with all such successful men, rewrote the family history to exaggerate his--undoubtedly predominant--position in the story. Peter Newman3 claims that after finishing the book Robertson phoned a Canadian journalist to say that "he had found out things about Sam they didn't want me to write about," and he told another responsible journalist that his "life had been threatened and we would know who was doing the threatening but that he would do the job himself"--a phone call after which the journalist immediately phoned the New York police who found Robertson dying of barbiturate poisoning. Over the years the story has natually added fuel to the Bronfman legend. But none of even the most vociferous conspiracy theorists has ever found any evidence of foul play, let alone anything damaging to Sam, or indeed any member of the Bronfman family.The next attempt was made by John Scott, a former editor at the Canadian edition of <i>Time</i> magazine, who was hired to counter books like that by Newman and the novel <i>Solomon Gursky Was Here</i> by Mordecai Richler, both perceived by the family as "anti-Semitic Jews." Scott spent seven years on and off before giving up. He was succeeded, for a very short time, by a journalist, Erna Paris, whose researches were terminated before she had even started. But in the late 1980s the family was lucky in finding in Professor Michael Marrus, a distinguished Jewish historian, an author worthy of Mr. Sam,4 but one whose interests lay more in the religious side of Mr. Sam's life than in the whiskey business.Not surprisingly Mr. Sam's sons and grandsons have always employed a team of PRs to protect the family from overmuch publicity. From my experience this has proved counterproductive. When I received the go-ahead for this book I naturally wrote, politely and repeatedly, to each member of the family involved to explain my objectives and my qualifications, such as they were, to write it. Neither Mr. Sam's elder son Edgar nor his grandson Edgar Jr.--normally known as "Junior"--were prepared to see me. Edgar's brother Charles wrote that he saw no reason for another book on the familybut was persuaded by a family friend to see me, amiably enough, for an hour-long meeting that he firmly stated did not constitute an interview. Only his sister Phyllis was frank and open with me. Not surprisingly other authors have found the family equally uncooperative. At his first interview with a prospective biographer, the Canadian journalist Rod McQueen, Edgar Jr. agreed to set up a series of interviews, but then canceled them all. This did not stop, indeed may indirectly have helped, McQueen's production of his valuable biography.5This sort of reclusive behavior is partly conditioned by a streak of "control freakery" that runs through the whole history. Nevertheless it--and the adventures of individual members over the years--have merely slaked, without satisfying, the thirst for shocks and horrors regarding the family on the part of the media, and indeed of the general public, and not just in their native Canada. For even today their fortunes remain colossal--despite the collapse of their empire <i>Forbes</i> magazine reckons that Mr. Sam's two sons, Edgar and Charles, are both worth over $2.5 billion, and dozens of family members are comfortably millionaires.The basic structure of this book, however, is the story of three extraordinary figures, "Mr. Sam," the founder of the business; his elder son, Edgar; and his grandson Edgar Jr., although the list of other characters involved is long and picturesque. Their activities and influence spread far beyond their native Canada and the liquor industry on which their fortunes were based. Edgar's story shines a powerful spotlight on the attitude and actions of the world Jewish community in the last twenty years of the twentieth century; while Edgar Jr. personified the great bubble that enveloped the communications industry in the late 1990s. Unlike other business dynasties, nothing they did was predictable or boring.The comparison often made, most obviously by Peter Newman, between the Bronfmans and the Rothschilds, is facile but misleading--apart from the fact that both were exceptionally rich and in both families the boys, as has been said, "were also Jewish princesses." But they were emphatically not comparable with the Rothschilds, who for two centuries have enjoyed worldwide fame and fortune. Mr. Sam may have been the King of the Canadian Jews but he was of no great importance on the world religious, social, or financial scene. For whereas the Rothschilds have always been numerous--the five arrows on the Rothschild crest indicate the wide geographical spread of the family fortune--the Bronfmans depended on the business genius of one man. Nevertheless, as Mitch Bronfman, grandson ofSam's brother Harry, put it, "All types of things"--including and inevitably financial generosity--"are expected of you because you're growing up in the shadow of a literally incredible guy called Sam."But the real reason for the comparison lies elsewhere, in the psychological need of the star-hungry Canadians for the ideal anti-hero whom they could loathe--as a rich Jewish bootlegger--while simultaneously craving for Sam, and probably even more his family, to provide some spice, some glamour, to a national scene notably lacking in such attributes. For, as Hugh MacLennan put it,6 "Apart from the CPR and the mining and forest industries, from the earliest beginnings of British North America the most successful and prominent businesses were brewing and distilling," and Mr. Sam was unquestionably king of the liquor business. Moreover--and unlike virtually all other business ...</p><h2>Geography: Realms, Regions, and Concepts, 17e WileyPLUS Learning Space Registration Card + Loose-leaf Print Companion</h2><p><p><i><b>This package includes an unbound, loose leaf copy of ISBN 9781118790205 and a registration code for the WileyPLUS Learning Space course associated with the text.

The authors review statistics in a way that is intended to reduce anxiety for students who feel intimidated by statistics. Conceptual underpinnings and practical applications are stressed, whereas algebraic derivations and complex formulas are reduced. New ideas are presented in the context of a few recurring examples, which allows readers to focus more on the new statistical concepts than on the details of different studies.<br><br>The authors' selection and organization of topics is slightly different from the ordinary introductory textbook. It is motivated by the needs of a behavioral science student, or someone in clinical practice, rather than by formal, mathematical properties. The book begins with hypothesis testing and then considers how hypothesis testing is used in conjunction with statistical designs and tests to answer research questions. In addition, this book treats analysis of variance as another application of multiple regression. With this integrated, unified approach, students simultaneously learn about multiple regression and how to analyze data associated with basic analysis of variance and covariance designs. Students confront fewer topics but those they do encounter possess considerable more power, generality, and practical importance. This integrated approach helps to simplify topics that often cause confusion.<br><br><b><i>Understanding Statistics in the Behavioral Sciences</i></b> features:*<b>Computer-based exercises, many of which rely on spreadsheets,</b> help the reader perform statistical analyses and compare and verify the results using either SPSS or SAS. These exercises also provide an opportunity to explore definitional formulas by altering raw data or terms within a formula and immediately see the consequences thus providing a deeper understanding of the basic concepts.<br>*<b>Key terms and symbols</b> are boxed when first introduced and repeated in a glossary to make them easier to find at review time.<br>*<b>Numerous tables and graphs,</b> including spreadsheet printouts and figures, help students visualize the most critical concepts.<br><br>This book is intended as a text for introductory behavioral science statistics. It will appeal to instructors who want a relatively brief text. The book's active approach to learning, works well both in the classroom and for individual self-study.</p><p></p><h2>Feuds about Families: Conservative, Centrist, Liberal, and Feminist Perspectives</h2><p><p> <b> </b> This unique anthology contains readings that represent three major perspectives--conservative, centrist, liberal/feminist--on 16 important and controversial marriage and family-related topics.

She was sentenced to death, but her hanging was delayed until after the birth of her baby. In North Carolina in 1830, a white woman living on an isolated farm was reported to have given sanctuary to runaway slaves. In this classic novel of courage and redemption, acclaimed author Sherley Anne Williams asks the question: "What if these two women had met?"</p><p>These two strong women, one black, one white, form a forbidden and ambivalent alliance as a bold scheme is hatched to win freedom. Trust is slowly extended and cautiously accepted as the women unite and discover greater strength together than alone. Bound by fate but divided by prejudice, they explore and defy racial barriers in a moving story of courage, freedom, friendship, and love. </p><p>Sherley Anne Williams (1944-1999) was a novelist, literary critic, an award-winning poet, and the author of short stories and several works for children. Williams's first collection of poetry, <em>The Peacock Poems</em>, was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award.

Hamlet is played by Simon Russell Beale. Imogen Stubbs plays Ophelia, Jane Lapotaire is Gertrude, and Bob Peck is Claudius. Polonius is played by Norman Rodway.]<br><br> Shakespeare's most famous play is one of the greatest stories in the literature of the world.<br><br> Distressed by his father's death and his mother's over-hasty remarriage, Hamlet, prince of Denmark is faced by a specter from beyond the grave bearing a grim message of murder and revenge. The young prince is driven to the edge of madness by his struggle to understand the situation he finds himself in and to do his duty. Many others, including Hamlet's beloved, the innocent Ophelia, are swept up in his tragedy.</p><p><p><b>William Shakespeare</b> (1564-1616), English poet and dramatist of the Elizabethan and early Jacobean period, is the most widely known author in all of English literature and often considered the greatest. He was an active member of a theater company for at least twenty years, during which time he wrote many great plays. Plays were not prized as literature at the time, and Shakespeare was not widely read until the middle of the eighteenth century, when a great upsurge of interest in his works began that continues today.</p><br><br><p><b>Simon Russell Beale</b> is an award-winning stage actor and recipient of numerous accolades, including the 1996 Olivier Award for Best Supporting Actor and the 2000 Olivier Award for Best Actor in a Musical. He is an associate of the National Theatre and the Almeida Theatre in London and an associate artist at the Royal Shakespeare Company.</p><br><br><p><b>Imogen Stubbs</b> made her name on stage with the Royal Shakespearean Company, notably as Desdemona in <i>Othello, </i> but she is probably best known to British audiences as Anna Lee, the private detective heroine on the 1990s TV series by the same name. She later played Sarah Spiller in the whimsical BBC kids series <i>Big Kids</i>. On film she had key roles in <i>Sense and Sensibility</i> and Shakespeare's <i>Twelfth Night</i>. She and her former husband, director Sir Trevor Nunn, have two children together.</p>Simon Russell Beale portrays the tragic Prince of Denmark in Shakespeare's most quoted play, with actress Imogen Stubbs playing the fair Ophelia. This production of HAMLET, produced exclusively for the Archangel Shakespeare audio collection, is a gem worthy of repeated listening. Paul Jesson provides a beautifully dramatic, but strangely un-ghostly, soliloquy as the King's ghost. Also in the cast are Jane Lapotaire as Gertrude, Bob Peck as the murderous and incestuous Claudius, and the late Norman Rodway as the garrulous Polonius. Music composed by Dominique Le Gendre supplies evocative interludes between scenes, and a handy printed insert provides a track list, cast list, and scene-by-scene summary of the play.

And yet, in the autumn of 1880, Daniel finds himself on the train to Cape Cod, where he will live among the coarse, dull surfmen and take orders from his crude, unsympathetic uncle, Captain Alder, the man in charge. At first Daniel&#39;s new life seems as comfortless and unrewarding as he had imagined, but the work is unexpectedly challenging, and to his surprise Daniel finds himself beginning to respect and admire the surfmen who risk their lives to save those lost in shipwrecks off the coast. Breathtaking adventure punctuates this lively, insightful coming-of-age story. An afterword traces the history of U.S. lifesaving from its origins to the present-day Coast Guard.</p><p>No BioGrade 5-8AIn the 1800s, crews of surfmen patrolled the treacherous Eastern coastline of America and rescued passengers and cargo from shipwrecks. Daniel, a 16-year-old from Boston, is doing poorly in school and begins to associate with the wrong crowd. His mother sends him to live with his demanding uncle, who is the captain of one of the crews. At first, Daniel detests his new environment and feels far superior to the unrefined men who made up the crew. However, as he adjusts to his new living conditions and takes part in their drills, he learns to appreciate the men's noble qualities and eventually wants to become one of them. In addition to his lifestyle changes, Daniel must also overcome a fear of heights. He later becomes a crucial player in the competition between different crews, and he even plays Cupid in the romance of one of the crewmen. While most of the action is in the daily details, in one daring rescue episode, Daniel proves that he is growing up. The historical period is nicely captured and the portrayal of the seacoast environment is in simple, but beautiful prose. The characters are well drawn and interesting.

Berlin takes readers through Marx's years of adolescent rebellion and post-university communist agitation, the personal high point of the 1848 revolutions, and his later years of exile, political frustration, and intellectual effort.

It has fascinated readers ever since it was first published in 1818.</p><p><i>Frankenstein,</i> loved by many decades of readers and praised by such eminent literary critics as Harold Bloom, seems hardly to need a recommendation. If you haven't read it recently, though, you may not remember the sweeping force of the prose, the grotesque, surreal imagery, and the multilayered <i>doppelg�nger</i> themes of Mary Shelley's masterpiece. As fantasy writer Jane Yolen writes of this (the reviewer's favorite) edition, "The strong black and whites of the main text [illustrations] are dark and brooding, with unremitting shadows and stark contrasts. But the central conversation with the monster--who owes nothing to the overused movie image ... but is rather the novel's charnel-house composite--is where [Barry] Moser's illustrations show their greatest power ... The viewer can all but smell the powerful stench of the monster's breath as its words spill out across the page. Strong book-making for one of the world's strongest and most remarkable books."

The mission conferred on him by his august patron, Mrs. Newsome, is to discover what, or who, is keeping her son Chad in the notorious city of pleasure, and to bring him home. But Strether finds Chad transformed by the influence of a remarkable woman; and as the Parisian spring advances, he himself succumbs to the allure of the 'vast bright Babylon' and to the mysterious charm of Madame de Vionnet.<br><br><strong>About the Series: </strong>For over 100 years <strong>Oxford World's Classics</strong> has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe.

The virtuous but self-deceiving Clarissa and the charming villain Lovelace haunt the imagination as fully as Romeo and Juliet or Tristan and Isolde.</p></p><p><b>Samuel Richardson</b> was born in Derbyshire in 1689, the son of a London joiner. He received little formal education and in 1707 was apprenticed to a printer in the capital. Thirteen years later he set up for himself as a stationer and printer and became one of the leading figures in the London trade. As a printer his output included political writing, such as the Tory periodical <b>The True Briton</b>, the newspapers, <b>Daily Journal</b> (1736-7) and <b>Daily Gazeteer</b> (1738), together with twenty-six volumes of the <b>Journals</b> of the House of Commons and general law printing. He was twice married and had twelve children.<p> His literary career began when two booksellers proposed that he should compile a volume of model letters for unskilled letter writers. While preparing this Richardson became fascinated by the project, and a small sequence of letters from a daughter in service, asking her father&#x2019;s advice when threatened by her master&#x2019;s advances, formed the germ of <b>Pamela; or, Virtue Rewarded</b> (1740-41). <b>Pamela</b> was a huge success and became something of a cult novel. By May 1741 it reached a fourth edition and was dramatized in Italy by Goldoni, as well as in England. His masterpiece, <b>Clarissa or, the History of a Young Lady</b>, one of the greatest European novels, was published in 1747-8. Richardson&#x2019;s last novel, <b>The History of Sir Charles Grandison</b>, appeared in 1753-4. His writings brought him great personal acclaim and a coterie of devoted admirers who liked to discuss with him the moral aspects of the action in the novels. Samuel Richardson died in 1761 and is buried in St Bride&#x2019;s Church, London. </p>Epistolary novel by Samuel Richardson, published in 1747-48. Richardson first presents the heroine, Clarissa Harlowe, when she is discovering the barely masked motives of her family, who want to force her into a loveless marriage to improve their fortunes. When Lovelace, a romantic who holds the code of the Harlowes in contempt, offers her protection, she runs off with him. She is physically attracted by if not actually in love with Lovelace, but she is to discover that he wants her only on his own terms and she refuses to marry him. In Lovelace's letters to his friend Belford, Richardson shows that what is driving him to conquest and finally to rape is really revenge for her family's insults and his sense of Clarissa's moral superiority. For Clarissa, however, accepting marriage as a convenience is no better than accepting the opportunistic moral code of her family. As the novel comes to its long-drawn-out close, she is removed from the world of both the Harlowes and the Lovelaces, and she dies true to herself to the end. -- <i>The Merriam-Webster Encylopedia of Literature</i></p><h2>The Jeremiah Study Bible, ESV, Black LeatherLuxe (Indexed): What It Says.

The brief paperback nature of this book makes it more approachable, and the well-respected author team has added several key pedagogical elements to help ensure students success. Complete with valuable career-based material, insightful guest speakers, illuminating real-world cases, and uniquely even-handed treatment of institutional and community sanctions, the text examines the U.S. correctional system from the perspectives of both the corrections worker and the offender, providing students with a well-rounded, balanced introduction to corrections.</p><p>Todd R. Clear is the Provost at Rutgers University in Newark, New Jersey. He is currently involved in studies of religion and crime, the criminological implications of &#34;place,&#34; and the concept of &#34;community justice.&#34; He serves as founding editor of the journal Criminology and Public Policy. Previous writing covers the topics of correctional classification, prediction methods in correctional programming, community-based correctional methods, intermediate sanctions, and sentencing policy. Clear has been elected to national office in the American Society of Criminology and the Academy of Criminal Justice Sciences. He has served as a programming and policy consultant to public agencies in over 40 states and five nations, and his work has been recognized through several awards, including those of the American Society of Criminology, the Academy of Criminal Justice Sciences, The Rockefeller School of Public Policy, the American Probation and Parole Association, and the International Community Corrections Association. Clear is the author of three books on community justice: COMMUNITY JUSTICE (Cengage Learning), WHAT IS COMMUNITY JUSTICE? (Sage), and THE COMMUNITY JUSTICE IDEAL (Westview). He is also author of IMPRISONING COMMUNITIES: HOW MASS INCARCERATION MAKES DISADVANTAGED PLACES WORSE (Oxford University Press).Clear's new edition takes a fundamentally sound treatment of corrections, and places it in a contemporary environment of technological advancement and fiscal austerity. The text does an admirable job of balancing the often-conflicting issues of public safety and human punishment. Features of the text permit the students to explore careers in corrections, and read about people working in corrections. An important feature of the text is that it permits students to be placed in ethical dilemmas in deciding what is the "right thing to do."<br><br>"This textbook presents the major concepts, themes, and controversies facing the U.S. correctional system in a way that many undergraduates will find appealing. The breadth of coverage for the number of pages in the chapters is praiseworthy. This book provides students with a basic grounding in corrections while also offering thought-provoking glimpses into the real-world application of justice in a correctional context."<br><br>"The book offers a practical, comprehensive and broad-based examination of corrections. The writing style is clear and concise. The text is poised to be one of the best on the market."<br><br>"Overall, the book is extremely well-written and informative. This approach is appealing to me. I like how the chapters are structured, with comprehensive, up-to-date information provided. The material included in each chapter is generally the information I would have chosen to include on the topic. New areas, such as the use of evidence-based probation supervision, are included, which is a departure from a lot of the standard texts which do not depart from material previously covered. Information is provided on many individual states, which is extremely important to compare and contrast, in my opinion. As a Californian, I was happy to see the most recent corrections crises presented correctly."<br><br>"The approach's strength lies in the organization of each chapter and the connections the author makes between the historical uses of correctional techniques and their contemporary application. Clear believes that we have outlived the days when we were not actually sure if mass-incarceration was effective as crime control. Now we know it is not. Yet, along with our 40-year incarceration binge, there has also been a decreasing crime rate, giving the proponents of our current policy fuel to continue it. Clear is aware of the balancing act researchers must execute as they present and interpret the findings of contemporary studies. He presents the relevant arguments in a fair and balanced manner."</p><h2>The Calm Center: Reflections and Meditations for Spiritual Awakening (An Eckhart Tolle Edition)</h2><p><b>Discover the Essence of Who You Really Are</b><br><br>These powerful meditations and poetic reflections will comfort, inspire, and gently bring you out of the hectic day-to-day and back to the bedrock of peace, and even joy, of your true, essential, and authentic self.

Ball</b> graduated from the Johns Hopkins Hospital School of Nursing, and subsequently received a BS from the Johns Hopkins University. She worked in the surgical, emergency, and outpatient units of the Johns Hopkins Children&#x2019;s Medical and Surgical Center, first as a staff nurse and then as a pediatric nurse practitioner, beginning her career as a pediatric nurse and advocate for children&#x2019;s health needs. Jane obtained both a master of public health and a doctor of public health degree from the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health with a focus on maternal and child health. After graduation she became the chief of child health services for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Department of Health. In this capacity she oversaw the state-funded well-child clinics and explored ways to improve education for the state&#x2019;s community health nurses. After relocating to Texas, she joined the faculty at the University of Texas at Arlington School of Nursing to teach community pediatrics to registered nurses returning to school for a BSN. During this time she became involved in writing her first textbook, <i>Mosby&#x2019;s Guide to Physical Examination</i>, which is currently in its seventh edition. After relocating to the Washington, DC, area, she joined Children&#x2019;s National Medical Center to manage a federal project to teach instructors of emergency medical technicians from all states about the special care children need during an emergency. Exposure to the shortcomings of the emergency medical services system in the late 1980s with regard to pediatric care was a career-changing event. With federal funding, she developed educational curricula for emergency medical technicians and emergency nurses to help them provide improved care for children. A textbook entitled <i>Pediatric Emergencies, A Manual for Prehospital Providers</i> was developed from these educational ventures. For 15&nbsp;years she managed the federally funded Emergency Medical Services for Children&#x2019;s National Resource Center. As executive director, Dr. Ball directed the provision of consultation and resource development for state health agencies, health professionals, families, and advocates about successful methods to improve the health care system so that children get optimal emergency care in all health care settings. Having left that position, she devotes more time to writing and serves as a consultant to the American College of Surgeons, supporting state trauma system development. In 2010, Dr. Ball received the Distinguished Alumna Award from the Johns Hopkins University.<br> <br> <b>Ruth C. Bindler</b> received her BSN from Cornell University&#x2014;New York Hospital School of Nursing. She worked in oncology nursing at Memorial-Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, and then moved to Wisconsin and became a public health nurse in Dane County, Wisconsin. Thus began her commitment to work with children as she visited children and their families at home, and served as a school nurse for several elementary, middle, and high schools. Due to this interest in child health care needs, she earned her MS in child development from the University of Wisconsin. A move to Washington State was accompanied by a new job as a faculty member at the Intercollegiate Center for Nursing Education in Spokane. Dr. Bindler has been fortunate to be involved for over 35 years in the growth of this nursing education consortium, which is a combination of public and private universities and colleges and is now the Washington State University (WSU) College of Nursing. Ruth obtained a PhD in human nutrition at WSU. She has taught theory and clinical courses in child health nursing, cultural diversity and health, graduate research, pharmacology, and assessment, as well as serving as lead faculty for child health nursing and Associate Dean for Graduate Programs. She is now a professor emeritus at Washington State University. Her first professional book, <i>Pediatric Medications</i>, was published in 1981, and she has continued to publish articles and books in the areas of pediatric medications and pediatric health. Research efforts are focused in the area of childhood obesity, type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and cardiometabolic risk factors in children. Ethnic diversity and interprofessional collaboration have been additional themes in her work. Dr. Bindler believes that her role as a faculty member has enabled her to learn continually, foster the development of students in nursing, lead and mentor junior faculty into the teaching role, and participate fully in the profession of nursing. In addition to teaching, research, publication, and leadership, she enhances her life by professional and community service, and by activities with her family.<br> <br> <b>Kay J. Cowen</b> received her BSN from East Carolina University in Greenville, North Carolina, and began her career as a staff nurse on the pediatric unit of North Carolina Baptist Hospital in Winston-Salem. She developed a special interest in the psychosocial needs of hospitalized children and preparing them for hospitalization. This led to the focus of her master&#x2019;s thesis at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro (UNCG), where she received a master of science in nursing education degree with a focus in maternal child nursing.<br> <br> Mrs. Cowen began her teaching career in 1984 at UNCG, where she continues today as clinical professor in the Parent Child Department. Her primary responsibilities include coordinating the pediatric nursing course, teaching classroom content, and supervising a clinical group of students. Mrs. Cowen shared her passion for the psychosocial care of children and the needs of their families through her first experience as an author in the chapter &#x201c;Hospital Care for Children&#x201d; in Jackson &amp; Saunders&#x2019; <i>Child Health Nursing: A Comprehensive Approach to the Care of Children and Their Families</i>, published in 1993.<br> <br> In the classroom, Mrs. Cowen realized that students learn through a variety of teaching strategies and became especially interested in the strategy of gaming. She led a research study to evaluate the effectiveness of gaming in the classroom and subsequently continues to incorporate gaming in her teaching. In the clinical setting, Mrs. Cowen teaches her students the skills needed to care for patients and the importance of family-centered care, focusing on not only the physical needs of the child but also the psychosocial needs of the child and family.<br> <br> During her teaching career, Mrs. Cowen has continued to work part time as a staff nurse: first on the pediatric unit of Moses Cone Hospital in Greensboro and then at Brenner Children&#x2019;s Hospital in Winston-Salem. In 2006 she became the part-time pediatric nurse educator in Brenner&#x2019;s Family Resource Center. Through this role she is able to extend her love of teaching to children and families.<br> <br> Through her role as an author, Mrs. Cowen is able to extend her dedication to pediatric nursing and nursing education. She is married and the mother of twin sons.<br> <br> <b>Michele R. Shaw</b> received her BSN from Pacific Lutheran University in Tacoma, Washington. She began her career as a nurse at a long-term care facility and then as a home healthcare nurse in Spokane, Washington. While making home visits, she became interested in the nursing care needs of children and families. She realized the importance of educating the family about their child&#x2019;s condition and to include family members while planning and carrying out the nursing care plan. This interest in family nursing led her into the area of maternal-child nursing, where she served as a postpartum nurse for nearly 18 years. Her experience with providing nursing care to families in various settings has highlighted her belief in the need of a family-centered approach in order to provide optimal nursing care. <br> <br> Dr. Shaw began her teaching career as a teaching assistant in 2001 at the Washington State University (WSU) College of Nursing, where she continues today as an associate professor. It was during those early years as a teaching assistant that she began to realize her passion for educating nursing students. This interest led to her completing a master&#x2019;s degree in nursing with an emphasis on education at WSU. Knowing that she wanted to continue working in nursing academia, Dr. Shaw went on to receive her PhD in nursing from the University of Arizona in Tucson. She has taught theory, seminar, and clinical courses in maternal-child nursing, family health, evidence-based practice, ethical decision making, physical assessment, and professional practice. Dr. Shaw recently assisted in the development of the Bachelor of Science-to-PhD in Nursing program at WSU. This fast-track program will enable students with an earned bachelor&#x2019;s degree to complete a PhD in nursing in four years.<br> <br> Dr. Shaw enjoys working with undergraduate and graduate students and encourages active participation in research. Her research interests include children with asthma and their families, childbearing women and their families, and substance use among youth and childbearing women. She is particularly interested in children&#x2019;s and families&#x2019; unique perspectives, and thus much of her research uses qualitative approaches. She continues to publish articles in the areas of pediatric asthma and substance use among childbearing women. Dr. Shaw believes her active role in nursing academia and research allows her to stay current in various pedagogical approaches to enhance nursing students&#x2019; learning experiences, as well as continuous learning about evidence-based interventions to provide nursing care to children and families.</p></p><h2>Cengage Advantage Books: Criminal Law</h2><p>Clear, concise, and cutting edge, Joel Samaha&#39;s best-selling CRIMINAL LAW, 11th Edition helps you apply criminal law&#39;s enduring foundations and principles to fascinating court cases and specific crimes.

A girls&#39; school, evacuated from London, has taken over Harefield Park. Miss Sparling seems to be the perfect headmistress: she dresses as a headmistress should and is an easy and erudite conversationalist. Her new neighbours like her and her pupils respect her, but there is something missing from her life; something which - though she never dreamt it when she arrived - perhaps Barsetshire can provide...</p><p>Angela Thirkell&#39;s gentle wit and her keen eye for the foibles, apparel, and surroundings of the English bourgeoisie is never more apparent than in this blithe story of the plucky heroine of the title. Miss Sparling is handsome, efficient, and immensely competent, and while Thirkell was hardly a latent feminist, the men in this book are mostly dependent husbands, worthless fops, or ironic and detached observers. Thirkell&#39;s work feeds our nostalgia for an idealized English countryside that is no more and, perhaps, never was.Angela Thirkell (1890-1961) was the eldest daughter of John William Mackail, a Scottish classical scholar and civil servant, and Margaret Burne-Jones. Her relatives included the pre-Raphaelite artist Edward Burne-Jones, Rudyard Kipling and Stanley Baldwin, and her grandfather was J. M. Barrie. She was educated in London and Paris, and began publishing articles and stories in the 1920s. In 1931 she brought out her first book, a memoir entitled<i> Three Houses</i>, and in 1933 her comic novel <i>High Rising</i> - set in the fictional county of Barsetshire, borrowed from Trollope - met with great success. She went on to write nearly thirty Barsetshire novels, as well as several further works of fiction and non-fiction. She was twice married and had four children.</p><h2>Word Journeys: Assessment-Guided Phonics, Spelling, and Vocabulary Instruction</h2><p>This book presents a highly practical approach to assessing children's spelling and word knowledge abilities and offering effective, appropriate instruction. Included is the Developmental Spelling Analysis (DSA), a dictated word inventory that enables teachers to quickly and easily evaluate students' stages of spelling development and their knowledge of important orthographic features. Detailed guidelines are set forth for engaging students in hands-on word study that is tailored to their specific strengths and weaknesses. Validated and field-tested, the instructional techniques described here reflect the author's many years of classroom experience. Particularly useful features of the book include narrative "snapshots" of children at different stages of spelling development; numerous examples of student work; suggested word sort activities for each orthographic feature; lists of recommended books and poems; and a focus on fostering a love of words through word play and language appreciation. Provided in the appendices are reproducible forms for administering the DSA, plus a list of over 12,000 words arranged by sound, pattern, and meaning-related features. <br></p><p>"Word Journeys brings together phonics and spelling--a blessing for teachers who are trying to juggle a mismatched collection of lessons and objectives. The program is grounded in a thorough analysis of English orthography, and provides the teacher with professional guidance for deciding what is important and what is not. The assessment techniques are practical within the time limits of the regular classroom, and should also be helpful to reading specialists for diagnosis."

Drawn mostly from the daughters and wives of the working poor and declass� elites, prostitutes in Shanghai were near the bottom of class and gender hierarchies. Yet they were central figures in Shanghai urban life, entering the historical record whenever others wanted to appreciate, castigate, count, regulate, cure, pathologize, warn about, rescue, eliminate, or deploy them as a symbol in a larger social panorama.<br><br>Over the past century, prostitution has been understood in many ways: as a source of urbanized pleasures, a profession full of unscrupulous and greedy schemers, a changing site of work for women, a source of moral danger and physical disease, a marker of national decay, and a sign of modernity. For the Communist leadership of the 1950s, the elimination of prostitution symbolized China's emergence as a strong, healthy, and modern nation. In the past decade, as prostitution once again has become a recognized feature of Chinese society, it has been incorporated into a larger public discussion about what kind of modernity China should seek and what kind of sex and gender arrangements should characterize that modernity.<br><br>Prostitutes, like every other non-elite group, did not record their own lives. How can sources generated by intense public argument about the "larger" meanings of prostitution be read for clues to those lives? Hershatter makes use of a broad range of materials: guidebooks to the pleasure quarters, collections of anecdotes about high-class courtesans, tabloid gossip columns, municipal regulations prohibiting street soliciting, police interrogations of streetwalkers and those accused of trafficking in women, newspaper reports on court cases involving both courtesans and streetwalkers, polemics by Chinese and foreign reformers, learned articles by Chinese scholars commenting on the world history of prostitution and analyzing its local causes, surveys by doctors and social workers on sexually transmitted disease in various Shanghai populations, relief agency records, fictionalized accounts of the scams and sufferings of prostitutes, memoirs by former courtesan house patrons, and interviews with former officials and reformers.<br><br>Although a courtesan may never set pen to paper, we can infer a great deal about her strategizing and working of the system through the vast cautionary literature that tells her customers how not to be defrauded by her. Newspaper accounts of the arrests and brief court testimonies of Shanghai streetwalkers let us glimpse the way that prostitutes positioned themselves to get the most they could from the legal system. Without recourse to direct speech, Hershatter argues, these women have nevertheless left an audible trace. Central to this study is the investigation of how things are known and later remembered, and how, later still, they are simultaneously apprehended and reinvented by the historian.</p><p><b>Gail Hershatter</b> is Professor of History and Co-Director of the Center for Cultural Studies at the University of California, Santa Cruz.

Fleming has been seen as the archetype for Bond, the jaunty, womanizing secret agent, a somewhat self-indulgent Englishman given to rich man's pursuits. In this book Donald McCormick, who knew Ian Fleming well, sets out to disprove the stereotype playboy image.<br>Fleming was one of four brothers. His father, a Conservative MP with a Scottish background, was killed in the Army in 1917, when Ian was nine. Consequently his mother, a dominant personality, exerted a strong influence on him. After Eton, Fleming went on to Sandhurst, but withdrew to try for the Foreign Office. He failed to enter the latter and subsequently worked in the City. In the war he came into his own and served with distinction, notably as Personal Assistant to the Director of British Naval Intelligence, with the rank of commander - signing his memoranda with the code-name '17F'. After the war he became foreign manager for Kemsley Newspapers. Following his much-acclaimed first novel, Casino Royale, published in 1953, Bond books appeared regularly until his death in 1964.<br>Donald McCormick reaches far and wide in this illuminating account of Ian Fleming's remarkable life, covering his wartime exploits and successful journalistic career as well as his marriage to Anne Rothermere and life at Goldeneye, his house in Jamaica. He shows Fleming as steadfast and loyal to others, but also as a restless man always seeking new talents in himself. Fleming's command of pace and innate romanticism, vital ingredients in his fiction, were ever present too in his many lifetime relationships and activities.</p><p>This rushed, journalistic coverage of the fascinating Fleming only rarely lives up to its sensational and complex subject, even while dispatching many of the occluding myths around him. Like Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Fleming did not originate the genre in which he wrote but instead gave it its enduring archetypal hero, James Bond, who in turn grafted himself onto Fleming's fame. McCormick (How to Buy an Island, 1973, etc.), Fleming's sometime junior colleague in wartime intelligence and global reporting, portrays the author as far more complex than his charismatic creation--both more ordinarily human and far more exotically eccentric. Though McCormick generally accounts for the biographical factors in Fleming's childhood (his father's death and his mother's strong nurturing) and his restless youth (studies in Germany and international reporting for Reuters), Fleming seems incomplete and distant by the time he has his crucial experience in naval intelligence in WW II under the code name ``17F.'' With these espionage operations still partially classified and permanently obscure, McCormick plays down Fleming's adventurism, with the exception of the bizarre case of Rudolph Hess. In the book's most mysterious chapter (which digs into Fleming's interest in the occult), McCormick places Fleming murkily in the plot that, by playing on Hess's superstitions and interest in astrology, lured the Nazi to England with the false promise of negotiating peace. McCormick paints a curiously selective portrait of Fleming's rise to fame--even his postwar career managing a global newspaper chain is given more attention than his turbulent marriage to the witty Lady Anne Rothermore or his phenomenally successful writing career. Although Fleming was ultimately a private character with a very public quasi-alter ego in James Bond, this thin work has the whitewashed feel of an authorized biography--but without the privileged access or intimacy with its subject. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>His authorship of the James Bond series so overshadowed everything else about Fleming (1908-1964) in the public mind that an intriguing life has been largely overlooked. McCormick, who knew Fleming during WWII and later as a newspaperman, has put together a workmanlike account that clears up erroneously reported details. A man of action and of high organizational skills, easily bored and perpetually restless, Fleming was making a name for himself as an international journalist before the war. A stint in the Navy turned into a key wartime role in British Naval Intelligence, and after the war he helped organize a syndicate of foreign correspondents, some of whom doubled as agents. The novels were written almost as a joke, and to help maintain an expensive wife, but they developed a life of their own that bemused and often amused Fleming, according to McCormick. Eventually, the movies took them over, and the books continued after Fleming's death under John Gardner's byline. There is much interesting and well-researched information here, but Fleming the man remains as elusive as he might well have wished. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Forbes Greatest Business Stories of All Time</h2><p>What do Bill Gates, Henry Ford, J.

After years of underground existence, this brilliant novel is emerging as a classic of visionary writing and still remains Hawkes's only work devoted solely to American life. As a 'surrealist Western" (<em>Newsweek</em>), and a violent and poetic portrayal of "a landscape of sexual apathy" (Albert J. Guerard), <em>The Beetle Leg</em> is a rich flight into the special vein of comedy that Hawkes had begun to exploit a decade before the popular acceptance of "black humor."</p><p>John Hawkes&nbsp;(1925&#x2013;1998) was a postmodern novelist born in Stamford, Connecticut, and educated at Harvard University.

This enormously influential book helped to spur a movement that has taken root around the U.S. and throughout the world. The second edition has been thoroughly updated to include the most important developments in this landscape revolution, along with the latest scientific research in the field. It has been expanded to provide even more ideas for designing, building, and maintaining environmentally sensitive landscapes. It is essential reading for everyone with an interest in "green" landscape design. <br>&nbsp; <br>Like its predecessor, the new edition of <i>Sustainable Landscape Construction</i> is organized around principles that reflect the authors' desire to put environmental ethics into practice. Each chapter focuses on one over-arching idea. These principles of sustainability are clearly articulated and are developed through specific examples.

A new chapter details ways in which landscape architectural practice must respond to the dangers posed by fire, floods, drought, extreme storms, and climate change. <br>&nbsp; <br><i>Sustainable Landscape Construction</i> is a crucial complement to basic landscape construction texts, and is a one-of-a-kind reference for professionals, students, and concerned citizens. <br></p><p><p>J.

Humans are represented in all three. An Exchange vessel mapping a distant frontier finds demons--a common image in the folklore of all known races--in suspended animation and sends an emergency warning. Each empire dispatches a team to investigate. Three sections of the book, told from the perspectives of each of the cultures, describe team members and how they were created. The three vessels converge on the planet where the warnings originated to find the first expedition destroyed and demons gone. The end of the first volume leaves the Exchange team trapped in the demons' edifice, apparently a multi-dimensional tesseractok , about to follow the other two teams into unknown worlds. Chalker's humans and aliens, and their political credos, are extremely well drawn, the shifting points of view gaining sympathy for all three sides.

Organized into thirteen chapters and complete with answers for all exercises, the text begins with the traditional eight parts of speech and moves on to ten basic sentence patterns. Making use of traditional sentence diagramming, the book proceeds to explain how the ten basic sentence patterns can be expanded into compound, complex, and compound-complex sentences, and how verbals (infinitives, gerunds, and participles) can provide further versatility. <p>Chapters dealing with the structure of the English language and diagrams to illustrate that structure are interspersed with chapters dealing with usage. The text addresses the most frequent usage errors by explaining how to distinguish between adjectives and adverbs; how to avoid problems of pronoun case, agreement, and consistency; how to ensure that verbs will agree with their subjects and will be appropriate in terms of tense, aspect, voice, and mood; and how to phrase sentences to avoid errors in parallelism or placement of modifiers.

Yet the term "gnosticism," which often connotes a single rebellious movement against the prevailing religions of late antiquity, gives the false impression of a monolithic religious phenomenon. Here Michael Williams challenges the validity of the widely invoked category of ancient "gnosticism" and the ways it has been described. Presenting such famous writings and movements as the <i>Apocryphon of John</i> and Valentinian Christianity, Williams uncovers the similarities and differences among some major traditions widely categorized as gnostic. He provides an eloquent, systematic argument for a more accurate way to discuss these interpretive approaches.</p><br><p> The modern construct "gnosticism" is not justified by any ancient self-definition, and many of the most commonly cited religious features that supposedly define gnosticism phenomenologically turn out to be questionable. Exploring the sample sets of "gnostic" teachings, Williams refutes generalizations concerning asceticism and libertinism, attitudes toward the body and the created world, and alleged features of protest, parasitism, and elitism. He sketches a fresh model for understanding ancient innovations on more "mainstream" Judaism and Christianity, a model that is informed by modern research on dynamics in new religious movements and is freed from the false stereotypes from which the category "gnosticism" has been constructed.</p></p><p><p>"Michael Williams presents the first treatment of gnosticism in book form that endeavors, and succeeds, to get out of beaten tracks by questioning the very definition and description of this phenomenon. He conducts a detailed analysis of the clich�s that have been in circulation for decades and shows convincingly how they have contributed to a distorted and biased approach to the sources. This book will be epoch-making for the field of gnostic studies and should attract a very large reading audience."<b>--Paul-Hubert Poirier, Universit� Laval</b></p><b>Michael Allen Williams</b> is Professor of Comparative Religion at the University of Washington, and is currently chair of the Department of Near East Languages and Civilization.

He believed his action would get him back to the States and a short jail sentence. Instead he found himself in another sort of prison, where for forty years he suffered under one of the most brutal and repressive regimes the world has known. This fast-paced, harrowing tale, told plainly and simply by Jenkins (with journalist Jim Frederick), takes the reader behind the North Korean curtain and reveals the inner workings of its isolated society while offering a powerful testament to the human spirit.</p><p>"This story by Robert Jenkins of his four decades in North Korea represents a rare opportunity to view life in one of the most reclusive societies in the world, offering unprecedented insights for both specialists and the general reader."&#x2015;Robert Scalapino, University of California, Berkeley<br><br>"This is an incredible story of betrayal, love and the search for redemption. Robert Jenkins is a modern-day Robinson Crusoe, isolated from the outside world, and relying on his wits to survive in a nightmarish parody of a nation where nothing is as it seems. Living in constant fear and violence, Jenkins's efforts to grow food, dig a well, heat his home, generate electricity and to find companionship, trust and ultimately love, lend this rough and ready narrative an unexpected depth. Set within the bizarre and Orwellian surroundings of North Korea during the late 20th century, Jenkins's account is like no other I've ever read."&#x2015;Jasper Becker, author of <i>Rogue Regime: The Continuing Threat of North Korea</i><br><br>"Charles Jenkins' memoir is a genuinely unique account of the only American ever to live in North Korea for most of his life and return to write about it. Part biography, part eyewitness testimony, part apology, this book takes Mr. Jenkins from a childhood in the segregated South to a U.S. Army ruling the roost in South Korea in the 1950s, to a North Korea that saw him as a real-life Martian, but a valuable one for use in Cold War propaganda."&#x2015;Bruce Cummings, Chairman of the History Department at the University of Chicago<b>Charles Robert Jenkins</b>&nbsp;was a former United States Army soldier who lived in North Korea from 1965 to 2004.

One Platoon's Descent into Madness in Iraq's Triangle of Death" (Crown Publishing, 2010) which the New York Times Book Review called "Riveting... A narrative that combines elements of 'In Cold Blood' and 'Black Hawk Down' with a touch of 'Apocalypse Now' as it builds toward its terrible climax... Frederick's extraordinary book is a testament to a misconceived war, and to the ease with which ordinary men, under certain conditions, can transform into monsters... Extraordinary." The Guardian called it "the best book by far about the Iraq war - a rare combination of cold truth and warm compassion."&nbsp;<br>Frederick is co-author, with former US Army Sergeant Charles Robert Jenkins, of "The Reluctant Communist: My Desertion, Court-Martial, and Forty-Year Imprisonment in North Korea," (University of California Press, 2008) which Commentary magazine called "one of the most important and devastating accounts of life inside a totalitarian society."

Texts that are organized the way the discipline structures itself intellectually no longer connect with the majority of student learners. This is not an issue of pandering to students or otherwise seeking the lowest common denominator. On the contrary, it is a question of again making the <i>practice of sociological thinking </i>meaningful, rigorous, and relevant to today&#x2019;s world of undergraduates.</p> <p></p> <p>This comparatively concise, highly visual, and <i>affordable </i>book offers a refreshingly new way forward to reach students, using one of the most powerful tools in a sociologist&#x2019;s teaching arsenal&#x2015;the familiar stuff in students&#x2019; everyday lives throughout the world: the jeans they wear to class, the coffee they drink each morning, or the phones their professors tell them to put away during lectures.</p> <p></p> <p>A focus on consumer culture, <i>seeing the strange in the familiar</i>,<i> </i>is not only interesting for students; it is also (the authors suggest) pedagogically superior to more traditional approaches. By engaging students through their stuff, this book moves beyond teaching <i>about </i>sociology to helping instructors teach <i>the practice</i> <i>of sociological thinking</i>. It moves beyond describing what sociology <i>is</i>, so that students can practice what sociological thinking <i>can do. </i>This pedagogy also posits a relationship between teacher and learner that is bi-directional. Many students feel a sense of authority in various areas of consumer culture, and they often enjoy sharing their knowledge with fellow students and with their instructor. Opening up the sociology classroom to discussion of these topics validates students&#x2019; expertise on their own life-worlds. Teachers, in turn, gain insight from the goods, services, and cultural expectations that shape students&#x2019; lives.</p> <p></p> <p>While innovative, the book has been carefully crafted to make it as useful and flexible as possible for instructors aiming to build core sociological foundations in a single semester. A map on pages ii&#x2013;iii identifies core sociological concepts covered so that a traditional syllabus as well as individual lectures can easily be maintained. Theory, method, and active learning exercises in every chapter constantly encourage the sociological imagination as well as the "doing" of sociology.</p></p><p><p><strong>Jos�e Johnston</strong> is Associate Professor of Sociology at the University of Toronto.

Wherry, Yale University</p> <p></p> <p>"Johnston, Cairns, and Baumann have produced something that Introductory Sociology instructors have long needed: a text that integrates the many diverse topics covered by sociology into a unifying theme. By focusing on the social processes surrounding consumption and consumerism &#x2015;the literal &#x2018;stuff&#x2019; of our students&#x2019; everyday lives&#x2015;the authors help students explore important sociological subjects such as globalization, inequality, subcultures, gender, identity, and much, much more.

Johnston, Cairns, and Baumann have compiled truly compelling chapters that apply core sociological concepts to the stuff&#x2015;clothes, food, cars, music, phones, etc.&#x2015;that surrounds our students today. Their focus on &#x2018;stuff&#x2019; allows instructors go beyond concepts covered in traditional sociology textbooks to emphasize contemporary ideas that sociologists actually use when we &#x2018;do sociology&#x2019;. This is the first nontraditional textbook I&#x2019;ve seen that really breaks the standard textbook mold and engages students in the practice of thinking sociologically!"</p> <p></p> <p>Julie A. Pelton, University of Nebraska Omaha</p> <p></p> <p>"Thanks to <i>Introducing Sociology</i>, your students in Introductory Sociology will never be able to look at their &#x2018;stuff&#x2019; in the same way.

Both professional chefs and serious amateur cooks are not only eager to invent new taste combinations and improve upon traditional methods, but they have set out to make sauces healthier and less rich as well. Until this book, however, they have had to rely on trial and error to produce innovative new sauces, as no single source systematically described the ingredients, methods, and principles used in making both classic sauces and modern variations. This comprehensive volume does just that, providing complete analyses of how both classic and contemporary sauces are constructed and flavored. Sauces explains how and why the ingredients for a sauce are combined. Over 300 recipes comprise not only classic and modern sauces but delicious first course and entree preparations that incorporate the sauce-making techniques described. - You&#39;ll also find practical discussions of the equipment and ingredients most commonly used by sauciers. Advice on how and when to use the different kinds of cookware, tools, machinery, and serving utensils. Selecting the highest-quality ingredients is key to preparing an excellent sauce, and you&#39;ll learn how to choose and use dairy products, herbs and spices, wines and spirits, mushrooms and truffles, chocolate, pork products, and other ingredients to their best advantage. A comprehensive glossary of terms and flow charts that illustrate the major classical sauce families and methods of preparation round out this reference to one of the most exciting and challenging areas of cooking.</p><p></p><h2>The EQ Difference: A Powerful Plan for Putting Emotional Intelligence to Work</h2><p>Co-published with SHRM.

It is his unique double perspective that makes his work so valuable. <br> Now Abraham Pais offers an illuminating portrait of another eminent colleague, J. Robert Oppenheimer, one of the most charismatic and enigmatic figures of modern physics. Pais introduces us to a precocious youth who sped through Harvard in three years, made signal contributions to quantum mechanics while in his twenties, and was instrumental in the growth of American physics in the decade before the Second World War, almost single-handedly putting American physics on the map. Pais paints a revealing portrait of Oppenheimer's life in Los Alamos, where in twenty remarkable, feverish months, under his inspired leadership, the first atomic bomb was designed and built, a success that made Oppenheimer America's most famous scientist. Pais, who was his next-door neighbor for many years, describes Oppenheimer's long tenure as Director of the Institute of Advanced Study at Princeton, but also shows how Oppenheimer's intensity and arrogance won him powerful enemies, who would ultimately make him one of the principal victims of the Red Scare of the 1950s. <br> Told with compassion and deep insight, <em>J. Robert Oppenheimer</em> is the most comprehensive biography of the great physicist available. It is Abraham Pais's final work, completed after his death by Robert P. Crease, an acclaimed historian of science in his own right.</p><p><br><strong>Abraham Pais</strong> was Detlev W. Bronk Professor Emeritus at The Rockefeller University in New York City. A leading theoretical physicist, he was also an esteemed science writer, the author of <em>'Subtle is the Lord...'</em> for which he won the American Book Award, <em>Inward Bound: Of Matter and Forces in the</em> <em>Physical World, Niels Bohr's Times</em>, and several other books. <strong>Robert P. Crease</strong> is a Professor in the Department of Philosophy at the State University of New York, Stony Brook, and historian at Brookhaven National Laboratory. His most recent book is <em>The Prism and the Pendulum: The Ten Most Beautiful</em> <em>Experiments in Science</em>.<br>*Starred Review* "We pursue him, and he eludes us." So John Leonard remarked about the maddeningly elusive physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer. And now the controversial scientist has slipped beyond the grasp of Pais, the much-acclaimed biographer of Einstein and Bohr. Pais, a longtime colleague of Oppenheimer, long postponed the writing of this life study because of deep personal ambivalence toward the man who presided over the making of America's first atomic bomb only to fall victim to McCarthy-era hysteria. As a consequence of that delay, Pais died before finishing his book. Surprisingly, readers may find that an unintentionally truncated book actually highlights the troubling incompleteness that Pais perceives in Oppenheimer's character. For although Pais details Oppenheimer's rare achievements as a researcher, teacher, and administrator, the portrait he finally delivers is that of a brilliant but arrogant mind falling short of lofty expectations. To the end of his life, Oppenheimer harbored a bitter consciousness of having himself failed to achieve any epoch-making discovery in the science he tirelessly promulgated. Pais' account of the personal contradictions within the man makes an excellent counterpoint to Bird and Sherwin's <i>American Prometheus</i> (2005), the award-winning, full-dress biography of Oppenheimer in which the emphasis falls on the more public side of his life, the Manhattan Project and its aftermath. In context with Bird and Sherwin, Pais offers an indispensable new look at the ever-enigmatic private Oppenheimer. <i>Bryce Christensen</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Katz initiates the provocative argument that the Holocaust is a singular event in human history. Unlike any previous work on the subject, <em>The Holocaust in Historical Context</em> maintains that the Holocaust is the only example of true genocide--a systematic attempt to kill all the members of a group--in history.<br> <br> In a richly documented, subtly argued, and amazingly wide-ranging comparative historical and phenomenological analysis, Katz explores the philosophical and historiographical implications of the uniqueness of the Holocaust. After he establishes the nature of genocide, Katz examines other occasions of mass death to which the Holocaust is regularly compared from slavery in the ancient world to the medieval persecution of heretics, from the depopulation of the New World to the Armenian massacres during World War I, and from the Gulag to Cambodia.<br> <br> In the first of three volumes, Katz, after setting the groundwork for his analysis with four chapters dealing with essential methodological issues, begins his comparative case studies with slavery in the ancient Greek and Roman world, and continues with such subjects as medieval antisemitism, the European witch craze, the medieval wars of religion, the medieval persecution of homosexuals, and the French campaign against Huguenots. Throughout this investigation of pre-modern Jewish and non-Jewish history, Katz looks at the ways in which the Holocaust has precedents and parallels, and in what way it stands alone as a singular, highly distinctive historical event.</p><p><br>Distinguished scholar Steven T. Katz is Professor of Jewish History and Thought in the Department of Near Eastern Studies at Cornell University. He has written extensively in the fields of Jewish studies and comparative mysticism and is the editor of the journal <em>Modern Judaism</em>.<br>"Promises to be one of the most important works in the area of Holocaust studies. It will certainly inspire much rethinking in the field."--Elie Wiesel, Boston University<br><br>"Katz provides a virtual encyclopedia of genocide...[establishing] that The Holocaust is a phenomenological and historical novum, a loginriel. This claim, long voiced as a generality, now receives confirmation through an exhaustive documentation which should correct much loose speech and<br>thought, and give a proper perspective to the Holocaust in the framework of universal history."--The Jerusalem Post<br><br>"From now on, no one will be able to discuss the uniqueness of the Holocaust without referring to the massive study of Steven Katz."--Raul Hilberg, University of Vermont<br><br>"The work of Professor Steven Katz is the fruit of years of careful and profound research. His excellent and impressive analysis of racism as an ideological and political phenomenon demonstrates an extraordinary contribution to comprehension of the Holocaust and events of mass killing in the<br>past."--Israel Gutman, Yad Vashem<br><br>"Katz's work is a supremely ambitious effort to come to grips historically with the massacre of European Jews and the intended elimination of the Jewish people worldwide. Matching the seriousness of this subject, his work is learned, carefully argued, imaginatively constructed, and of<br>breathtaking scope--extending from ancient times to the modern era. This is a truly remarkable achievement, to be pondered by everyone who wants to situate this unparalleled catastrophe in our world of catastrophic events."--Michael R. Marrus, University of Toronto<br><br>"An epic undertaking, Professor Katz's comprehensive study of a sad and sensational subject, mass murder from Antiquity to the Present, not only demonstrates a mastery of historical detail but clarifies important matters of definition that surround the Holocaust as a genocidal event.<br>Scrupulously informed and trenchantly critical, his book raises the level of debate. No one interested in the question of the specificity of the Holocaust can afford to neglect this volume."--Geoffrey Hartman, Yale University<br><br>"Within the last decade the volume of research and writing on the Holocaust and related subjects has increased exponentially. To the generalist, it would seem the field is fully occupied with specialized monographs. Professor Katz is not elbowing his way into that crowded pack, however....He<br>has written a work which will take its place by the sheer mass of research, comprehensive scholarship, and authoritative interpretations. Quite simply, no scholar will be able to do without reference to it. With equal certainty, no one will even attempt something to supersede it for many years to<br>come."--Franklin H. Littell, Baylor University<br><br>"Steven Katz has written one of the few books on the Holocaust that is truly indispensable for both the intelligent reader and the scholar. Comprehensive, thorough, challenging, this book is destined to be the focus of debate and reflection for years to come."--Richard L. Rubenstein, Florida<br>State University<br><br>"Steven Katz's study of the Holocaust in Historical Context presents the first detailed overview of genocide as a human activity. Its scrupulous scholarship, its unflinching focus makes it the most important single historical work on genocide ever published."--Sander L. Gilman, Cornell<br>University<br><br>"After Katz's landmark study, the debate will surely continue, but on a considerably higher plane than heretofore."--Christopher Browning, Pacific Lutheran University</p><h2>Equine Massage: A Practical Guide (Howell Equestrian Library)</h2><p>A long-awaited update of the classic equine massage reference<br>Fully revised and updated, this new edition provides step-by-step instructions and more than 180 photographs and diagrams to help riders and professionals alike master equine massage techniques.

As the stench lingered, outraged residents feared that the foul air would breed an epidemic. Fifteen years later&#x2015;when the City of Light was in the grips of another Great Stink&#x2015;the public conversation about health and disease had changed dramatically. Parisians held their noses and protested, but this time few feared that the odors would spread disease. </p><p>Historian David S. Barnes examines the birth of a new microbe-centered science of public health during the 1880s and 1890s, when the germ theory of disease burst into public consciousness. Tracing a series of developments in French science, medicine, politics, and culture, Barnes reveals how the science and practice of public health changed during the heyday of the Bacteriological Revolution.</p><p>Despite its many innovations, however, the new science of germs did not entirely sweep away the older "sanitarian" view of public health. The longstanding conviction that disease could be traced to filthy people, places, and substances remained strong, even as it was translated into the language of bacteriology. Ultimately, the attitudes of physicians and the French public were shaped by political struggles between republicans and the clergy, by aggressive efforts to educate and "civilize" the peasantry, and by long-term shifts in the public's ability to tolerate the odor of bodily substances.</p></p><p><p>Explores the scientific and social factors that continue to influence the public's lingering uncertainty over how disease can&#x2015;and cannot&#x2015;be spread.</p><p><b>David S.

Drawing on her own experience of losing her young husband to cancer, Lisa Belcher Hamilton accommodates the practice of fixed-hour prayer for those who mourn in For Those We Love but See No Longer: Daily Offices for Times of Grief. Fixed-hour prayer may be especially suited for times of grief, Hamilton explains, because it provides structure and comfort throughout the day.

He studied at the University of Fort Hare until he was expelled for participating in a student protest. He became a leading member of the ANC until 1963, when he was arrested, tried and sentenced to life imprisonment. He spent the next eighteen years in the maximum-security prison for political prisoners on Robben Island, and was later moved to Pollsmoor Prison. During his incarceration he became a potent symbol for the anti-apartheid movement, and in response to increasing domestic and international pressure was finally freed on 11 February 1990. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993, and in 1994 was elected president of South Africa in its first multiracial elections. He led the country until 1999.

Yonge was born to a Christian family and her values played a strong role in her writings. Yonge&#39;s books earned much praise during her lifetime including from other esteemed authors such as George Eliot, Lewis Carroll, and Anthony Trollope. The Little Duke, published in 1854, is one of Yonge&#39;s most popular novels. The action centers around a young boy who must learn tough life lessons after becoming duke at an early age. The action is set in Normandy before the time of William the Conqueror.</p><p>Charlotte Mary Yonge (1823&#x2013;1901), was an English novelist, known for her huge output, now mostly out of print. She began writing in 1848, and published during her long life about 160 works, chiefly novels. Her first commercial success, The Heir of Redclyffe (1853), provided the funding to enable the schooner Southern Cross to be put into service on behalf of George Selwyn. Similar charitable works were done with the profits from later novels. Yonge was also a founder and editor for forty years of The Monthly Packet, a magazine (founded in 1851) with a varied readership, but targeted at British Anglican girls (in later years it was addressed to a somewhat wider readership). Among the best known of her works are The Heir of Redclyffe, Heartsease, and The Daisy Chain. A Book of Golden Deeds is a collection of true stories of courage and self-sacrifice. She also wrote Cameos from English History, Life of John Coleridge Patteson: Missionary Bishop of the Melanesian Islands and Hannah More. Her History of Christian Names was described as "the first serious attempt at tackling the subject" and as the standard work on names in the preface to the first edition of Withycombe's The Oxford Dictionary of English Christian Names, 1944. Her personal example and influence on her god-daughter, Alice Mary Coleridge, played a formative role in Coleridge's zeal for women's education and thus, indirectly, led to the foundation of Abbots Bromley School for Girls. After her death, her friend, assistant and collaborator, Christabel Coleridge, published the biographical Charlotte Mary Yonge: her Life and Letters (1903).</p><h2>Sacagawea: A Biography (Greenwood Biographies)</h2><p><p>Sacagawea, kidnapped as an adolescent and sold as a slave to a French-Canadian fur trader, is best known for her role as interpreter and symbol of goodwill for Lewis and Clark on their journey west. Despite her pivotal role in this era of Manifest Destiny and blending cultures, much of her ensuing life story remains uncertain, thanks to a larger focus on Lewis and Clark themselves, as well as the perpetuation of legend over fact in several 20th century movies and publications. This concise and readable biography offers an objective treatment of Sacagawea's childhood, her journey with Lewis and Clark, her later life, her explorer son, and the mythology surrounding her death and legacy.

The book is guaranteed to delight anyone who has a professional or amateur interest in science.</p><p>A Random Walk in Science, which was published ... as a collection of such fundamental material, has come to be held as a kind of text for all science, the ultimate peak of that pyramid which begins with primary publications at the bottom and then ascends to review articles, reviews of reviews, and so on.<br><br>Now this sequel, collecting some 175 or so additional short pieces, can be added to that lofty edifice. Here, for everyone, there is something, whether whimsy like 'The Use of Small Dogs in Physics Teaching' or broad jokes like the investigator who ate dehydrated food for 28 days and then gained 108 lbs in ten minutes while caught in a rainstorm. Parody ranges from the predictably amusing 'I am the very model of ...' to the arcane, such as Shelley's Ozymandias ('Two vast and trunkless legs of stone/Stand in the desert ... Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair! ...'), rewritten as the geology paper 'Twin Limb-Like Basalt Columns and Their Relationship to Plate Tectonics.'<br><br>Scientists cannot resist applying scientific observation to their own endeavors, yielding, for example, a description of their university hierarchy, from the dean who leaps tall buildings in a single bound, through professor (leaps short buildings with a running start and favorable winds), graduate student (runs into buildings), and finally department secretary (lifts buildings and walks under them). There is also a piece which rings true on the various obstructionists on committees and panels, and another on the 'game' of refereeing. (The author's goal is to publish a worthless paper; the referee's is to have a major contribution to the field refused, 'No matter what degree of rigor the author uses, the referee replies by saying that it is not the correct one.').<br>-Nature</p><h2>Super Consciousness: The Quest for the Peak Experience</h2><p><p>History is laced with examples of individuals who have experienced states of powerfully heightened awareness.

In arguing that Christian beliefs about God and the world can be disengaged from complicity with social forces of reaction and oppression, Tanner discloses the radical potential of Christian beliefs and realigns them with efforts to bring about a just society.</p><p>Kathryn Tanner is Dorothy Grant Maclear Professor of Theology at the University of Chicago Divinity School. She is the author of Economy of Grace (2005) and Jesus, Humanity and the Trinity: A Brief Systematic Theology (2001).Tanner (religious studies, Yale) critiques the relationship between theology and political commitments in order "to show how Christian beliefs about God and the world may be disentangled from a history of use in support of a status quo of injustice and reconstituted as a resource for commitment to progressive social change." Tanner grounds her progressive political beliefs in traditional, rather than radical or liberation, theology. She finds traditional theology more open to self-criticism; views of a transcendent God provide correctives that views of an immanent God cannot; and traditional theology does not usurp the place of sociopolitical analysis as revisionist theology sometimes does.

This collection from the 50-year long career of America&#39;s preeminent nature writer illustrates the full range of Hay&#39;s work. An elegant and lyrical stylist, he is, in Merrill&#39;s words, &#34;the nature writer&#39;s writer, an illustrator of the Emersonian notion that &#39;the world is emblematic.&#39;&#34; And so Hay reveals the ubiquitous but often unnoticed emblems all around us. The mad, impossible rush of alewives flinging themselves upstream to mate, for example, represents &#34;the drive to be, a common and terrible sending out, to which men are also bound in helplessness.&#34; In the migratory movements of the terns and the green turtles past his beloved Cape Cod Hay sees the mystery and magnificence of homing: &#34;To know your direction and return through outer signs, is as new as it is ancient. We are still people of the planet, with all its original directions waiting in our being.&#34; Whether describing the rugosa or bayberry of a sand dune, the plight of stranded pilot whales, or a spider swinging on its gossamer, Hay encourages us to enlarge our inner universe by observing, appreciating, and preserving the outer one we so often ignore. As a result, he says, &#34;we may find that we are being led onto traveled ways that were once invisible to us,&#34; and by recognizing our &#34;deep alliance with natural forces we find a new depth in ourselves. This is the common ground for all living things.&#34;</p><p>6 x 9 trim.

He died in a private-plane crash in 1970. Graham ( Cowboys and Cadillacs ) describes Murphy's wartime exploits and film career in engrossing detail and keeps a probing eye on his subject's character, personality and behavior, building a convincing case that Murphy was a victim of post-traumatic stress disorder. In his postwar years, the actor was a twice-married womanizer who gambled away an estimated $3 million, served as an auxiliary crime-fighter for various police departments while consorting with gangsters, devoted himself to concocting crude practical jokes and regularly threatened to kill anyone who crossed him. (Two years before his death he was tried and acquitted of attempted murder.) Aside from his awesome war record and struggle to improve his shaky acting skills, there seems little about Murphy to admire, but Graham, history professor at the Univ. of Texas, paints a portrait of a man more to be pitied than scorned. The book is the well-told tale of a lost soul who lived an extraordinary life. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.Graham brings two advantages to his biography of war hero/movie star Murphy: like Murphy he was raised in rural Texas; and as a professor of English, Graham is capable of composing a literate sentence. Murphy, America's most decorated soldier in World War II, went on to become a top movie draw in the 1950s via a series of low-budget Westerns. As Graham shows, Murphy suffered acutely from post-combat stress syndrome, and until his death in a plane crash in 1971, Murphy's life was an unhappy one. No Name on the Bullet does a good job of covering both Murphy's military and film careers, and it is a biography well above the average.<br><i>- John Smothers, Monmouth Cty.

And certainly what Melville did for whaling Austen does for marriage--tracing the intricacies (not to mention the economics) of 19th-century British mating rituals with a sure hand and an unblinking eye. As usual, Austen trains her sights on a country village and a few families--in this case, the Bennets, the Philips, and the Lucases. Into their midst comes Mr. Bingley, a single man of good fortune, and his friend, Mr. Darcy, who is even richer. Mrs. Bennet, who married above her station, sees their arrival as an opportunity to marry off at least one of her five daughters. Bingley is complaisant and easily charmed by the eldest Bennet girl, Jane; Darcy, however, is harder to please. Put off by Mrs. Bennet's vulgarity and the untoward behavior of the three younger daughters, he is unable to see the true worth of the older girls, Jane and Elizabeth. His excessive pride offends Lizzy, who is more than willing to believe the worst that other people have to say of him; when George Wickham, a soldier stationed in the village, does indeed have a discreditable tale to tell, his words fall on fertile ground. </p><p> Having set up the central misunderstanding of the novel, Austen then brings in her cast of fascinating secondary characters: Mr. Collins, the sycophantic clergyman who aspires to Lizzy's hand but settles for her best friend, Charlotte, instead; Lady Catherine de Bourgh, Mr. Darcy's insufferably snobbish aunt; and the Gardiners, Jane and Elizabeth's low-born but noble-hearted aunt and uncle. Some of Austen's best comedy comes from mixing and matching these representatives of different classes and economic strata, demonstrating the hypocrisy at the heart of so many social interactions. And though the novel is rife with romantic misunderstandings, rejected proposals, disastrous elopements, and a requisite happy ending for those who deserve one, Austen never gets so carried away with the romance that she loses sight of the hard economic realities of 19th-century matrimonial maneuvering. Good marriages for penniless girls such as the Bennets are hard to come by, and even Lizzy, who comes to sincerely value Mr. Darcy, remarks when asked when she first began to love him: "It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began. But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley." She may be joking, but there's more than a little truth to her sentiment, as well. Jane Austen considered Elizabeth Bennet "as delightful a creature as ever appeared in print".

How does society encourage the kind of market economy that generates continually increasing incomes? How do particular styles of government affect economic performance? World-renowned economist Mancur Olson tackles these questions and others in what will surely be regarded as his magnum opus.Olson contends that governments can play an essential role in the development of markets. Reliable enforcement of private contracts and protection of individual rights to property depend on governments strong enough to guarantee these rights yet constrained enough not to undermine them. His exploration of &#x201c;market-augmenting governments&#x201d; will stand as a cutting-edge work on economic growth and provide a useful framework in which to consider the Asian financial crisis and its aftermath. As Susan Lee noted in Forbes, &#x201c;his pioneering insights might have won a Nobel Prize for Olson had he lived a bit longer.&#x201d;</p><p>Mancur Olson (1932-1998) was Distinguished Professor of Economics at the University of Maryland.Olson, whose Logic of Collective Action stands as a landmark work of political economy, died in 1998 before putting the finishing touches on this book. As it stands, it serves as an appropriate coda to Olson's long and productive career, summarizing his major achievements while still contributing new insights to the post-communist debates. As he grapples with the forces that undermine economic vitality, Olson worries over a central question: Why has economic performance been so much better after the defeat of fascism in Germany and Japan than after the collapse of communism in Soviet-style states? In probing this question, Olson examines the complex relationships between the role of the state and economic performance, arguing that "there is no way of explaining the extreme poverty of many nations without taking account of the extent to which they are misgoverned." The lay reader will easily grasp Olson's broad and practical--if not especially vivid--discussions, and specialists will value his excellent analyses of the economic machinations of Soviet-type autocracies, including a fine reading of Stalin's diabolical manipulation of Russia's tax structures. As the world attempts to salvage what's left of the post-communist economies, it must contend with disablingly high rates of inflation and inefficient, state-owned businesses. The challenge ahead is not merely to hasten privatization, Olson says. Instead, economists must work to ensure that a "market-augmenting government" first secures individual rights to private property and guarantees the impartial enforcement of contracts--in his view the two essential ingredients for prosperity.

They ruled it for another hundred, departing in 1947, leaving behind the independent states of India and Pakistan. British rule taught Indians to see themselves as Indians and its benefits included railways, hospitals, law and a universal language. But the Raj, outwardly so monolithic and magnificent, was always precarious. Its masters knew that it rested ultimately on the goodwill of Indians. This is a new look at a subject rich in incident and character; the India of the Raj was that of Clive, Kipling, Curzon and Gandhi and a host of lesser known others. RAJ will provoke debate, for it sheds new light on Mountbatten and the events of 1946-47 which ended an exercise in benign autocracy and an experiment in altruism.</p><p>Lawrence James was born in Bath and was educated at the University of York and Merton College, Oxford.

Drawn with deliberate primitivism, the artwork has the flat simplicity and awkward panel transitions redolent of comics drawn during fifth-grade social studies, lacking only a blue-lined-paper background for the images. The visuals are a mishmash of imagery, and while the suitors, Odysseus, and Telemachus remain primarily influenced by 1930s pulp sci-fi design, cars, bathing suits, Arthurian wizards, and Hellenic helmets also make appearances. This works quite well, giving the various islands and kingdoms diverse aspects, and providing an accessibly fanciful context. The adaptation loses almost all of the original phraseology, but keeps the sprawling list of characters tertiary to the main action, as well as many of the plot mechanics soothed over by other retellings. The compressed sequence of events and the lack of cultural background makes Odysseus come off rather badly as the hero of his eponymous epic, and a brief epilogue only helps minimally in providing perspective on his literary endurance. This is a complicated, sprawling work with much more complexity of character and event than might be inferred from the faux simplicity of the composition, and it maintains some of the ambiguity, scope, and bawdy content of the original poem.

In Profit from the Core, strategy expert Chris Zook revealed how to grow profitably by focusing on and achieving full potential in the core business. But what happens when your core business provides insufficient new growth or even hits the wall? In Beyond the Core, Zook outlines an expansion strategy based on putting together combinations of adjacency moves into areas away from, but related to, the core business, such as new product lines or new channels of distribution. These sequences of moves carry less risk than diversification, yet they can create enormous competitive advantage, because they stem directly from what the company already knows and does best. Based on extensive research on the growth patterns of thousands of companies worldwide, including CEO interviews with 25 top performers in adjacency growth, Beyond the Core 1) identifies the adjacency pattern that most dramatically increases the odds of success: &#34;relentless repeatability;&#34; 2) offers a systematic approach for choosing among a range of possible adjacency moves; and 3) shows how to time adjacency moves during a variety of typical business situations. Beyond the Core shows how to find and leverage the best avenues for growth--without damaging the heart of the firm.</p><p>Chris Zook is a Director of Bain &amp; Company and leads the company's Global Strategy Practice.

Tour.</p><p>WW II hero Foss (as a Marine pilot, he shot down 26 Japanese planes) went on to serve two terms as governor of South Dakota, as commissioner of the American Football League and host of the TV series The American Sportsman and The Outdoorsman. The first half of his autobiography--written with his wife--is a conventional, entertaining account of his upbringing on a Midwestern farm, his introduction to flying in the 1930s and his wartime aerial exploits. The second half disappoints as Foss jumps from one event to the next in a kind of outline of his multiple postwar careers. A man of action, Foss offers fairly unsurprising observations, with two exceptions. The first of these is his eyewitness testimony that future senator Joseph McCarthy participated in dangerous air missions in the South Pacific; the second is his defense of his friend the late Charles Lindbergh against charges of disloyalty and anti-Semitism. With a fairly ingenuous charm, Foss highlights his receiving the Medal of Honor from FDR and the thrill of being interviewed by Lawrence Welk. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Tower (Guardians of Destiny)</h2><p>In a fertile valley undisrupted by the aether-shattering death of the old Aian Empire, the Tower and its Guardians have entertained generations of wealthy mirror-scrying mages while adventurers from around the world risk their lives for fortune and fame. But on the one day the Tower stood unguarded, an intruder tried to seize the magic powering the vast structure. Now, locked out of the Tower&#x2019;s innermost chambers, Kerric Vo Mos must brave the deadly traps keeping trespassers at bay in order to reclaim control. <br><br>Unfortunately, Kerric wields a pen far better than a sword, and the way into the Tower&#x2019;s sanctum is treacherous. Only the help of an experienced player like Myal the Mendhite can get him to where he must go. But mutual respect will not be enough. Passion must also be employed, along with armor and weapons, as they embark on a perilous quest past monsters, riddles, and other dangers that even the Tower&#x2019;s most dedicated viewers have never seen before.</p><p><b>Jean Johnson</b> lives in the Pacific Northwest with her family.Praise for the novels of Jean Johnson:<br><br>&#x201c;Jean Johnson spins an intriguing tale of destiny and magic.&#x201d; &#x2014;Robin D.

Both are remembered for massacres and devastation; yet whereas Genghis is also famous for the laws he imposed on half of Asia and for the trade which flourished under Mongol rule, Attila's notoriety seems unrelieved by positive achievements. But what was Attila's short-lived empire really like? What happened to the Huns afterwards, and what role did the nomads of Central Asia play in the centuries between Attila and Genghis Khan?</p><p>An unrivalled illustrated reference source on fighting men and commanders, past and present.

The film studio where Clara Vine works is churning out movies, but each day that she stays in Germany is more dangerous than the last. Spying on the private life of the Third Reich, passing secrets to contacts in British intelligence, falling into a passionate affair&#x2014;any of these risky moves could get Clara shot. So she is wholly shaken when someone close to her is murdered instead. The victim is Lottie Franke, an aspiring costume designer and student at the prestigious Faith and Beauty finishing school that trains young women to become the wives of the Nazi elite. While the press considers Lottie&#x2019;s death in the Grunewald forest the act of a lone madman, Clara uncovers deeper threads, tangled lines that seem to reach into the darkest depths of the Reich&#x2014;and to a precious discovery that Hitler and his ruthless cohorts would kill for.<br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> <b>Previously published in the U.K. as <i>Faith and Beauty</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Praise for Jane Thynne&#x2019;s first Clara Vine novel, <i>The Scent of Secrets</i></b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> &#x201c;A brilliant tale of spies and secrets, of intense psychological drama, of edgy climax and one extraordinary heroine.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;Beatriz Williams, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>A Hundred Summers</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;A compelling story of love and betrayal in Hitler&#x2019;s Berlin . . .

The day itself had been declared a National Holiday and the largest military parade ever held&#x2014;five hours&#x2019; worth of storm troopers, hurricane troopers, tornado troopers, and every other type of trooper&#x2014;was proceeding along the new East-West Axis, the great triumphal boulevard that ran all the way from Unter den Linden to the Olympic Stadium. Guns and tanks glittered in the morning air as the boots of fifty thousand soldiers thudded rhythmically into the ground. One hundred and sixty-two Heinkel bombers, Messerschmitt fighters, and Stuka dive-bombers performed flybys at five-minute intervals, leaving lightning flashes of vapor in the sky. Deputations of the Hitler Youth and League of German Girls had arrived from all over Germany. There were armored cars, cannons, Howitzers, and antiaircraft guns. And more than a million spectators, most of them carrying black bread sandwiches, bottles of beer, and swastika flags.<br><br>Clara Vine shuffled her feet and looked down at her glossy Ferragamo leather pumps. They were hand-stitched in Florence, had cost the earth, and they hurt like hell.<br><br>Why on earth had she not worn comfortable shoes?<br><br>She was hungry and thirsty and longing to sit down. She had been there since nine that morning, but had only managed to secure a place three deep opposite the F�hrer&#x2019;s saluting podium on the Charlottenburger Chaussee. The view to her right was obscured by a large woman with a squashed felt hat, accompanied by two boys of around six and seven. At first Clara had pitied the children, doomed to spend the morning fenced in by a forest of legs, but after hours of their relentless wails, demanding to know when exactly the F�hrer was coming and how much longer would he be, her sympathy was wearing thin. To her left stood a war veteran, medals pinned proudly to his chest, saluting frenetically like someone with uncontrollable muscle spasms. He had come all the way from Saxony, and he was not the only one. Thousands of visitors had poured into Berlin. The stations were teeming, and every hotel from the Adlon down was booked solid. People who couldn&#x2019;t afford anywhere else had pitched their tents in the parks.<br><br>Like all birthdays, Hitler&#x2019;s special day had begun with presents, but that was where the ordinariness ended. Vast marble tables had been assembled in the Reich Chancellery to display Meissen porcelain, silver candlesticks, and Titian paintings, alongside rather more modest gifts from ordinary people, largely made up of swastika cakes and cushions. The Pope, the King of England, and Henry Ford had sent telegrams. The engineer Ferdinand Porsche had presented Hitler with a shiny black convertible VW Beetle. Rudolf Hess had acquired a collection of priceless letters written by the F�hrer&#x2019;s hero, Frederick the Great, and Albert Speer had given him an entire scale model of &#x201c;Germania&#x201d;&#x2014;the new world capital, with buildings made out of balsa wood and glass and a thirteen-foot model of the proposed triumphal arch. This was, without doubt, Hitler&#x2019;s favorite present, and he pored over it like a boy with a train set until he could be persuaded to tear himself away.<br><br>On the face of it, Berlin was putting on a magnificent show. Gigantic white pillars had sprouted all along major thoroughfares. The newsstands groaned with souvenir birthday issues. Swastikas sprouted from every conceivable surface. Spring was a riot of color in Berlin, so long as the colors were red and black.<br><br>Beneath the birthday bunting, however, everything was a little shabbier in Germany&#x2019;s capital. The tablecloths in the restaurants were spotted because there was no detergent, the bread was sawdust, and the ersatz coffee undrinkable. People looked the other way on the trams because there was no toothpaste, precious few razor blades or shaving foam, and the sour odor of humanity and unwashed clothes hung in the U-Bahn. Even high-class nightclubs like Ciro&#x2019;s stank of low-grade cigarettes, and taxis home were nonexistent because of the gas shortage.<br><br>After the previous year&#x2019;s Anschluss, when Germany annexed Austria, followed by the bloodless seizure of Czechoslovakia that March, most of Europe guessed a war was on the way. When it happened, it would be Poland&#x2019;s fault, according to the Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda, which ensured that newspapers were black with seventy-two-point headlines screaming belligerent revenge on the Poles for their atrocities against Germans in the disputed &#x201c;Polish corridor.&#x201d; poland, look out! There had been murderous attacks on Germans in Danzig. God help any country that stood in Germany&#x2019;s way.<br><br>Looking around her, Clara guessed that despite the marching and the machines, no one in this great big birthday pageant really wanted war. The ghost of the last war was still in their eyes, and the thought of what another would do haunted all but the very young. Only the little boys beside her, who now had squeezed between the legs of the storm troopers guarding the route, saw anything thrilling in the inexorable wall of men and tanks rolling past. Everyone else was getting by on an edgy cocktail of hope and denial. Everywhere you went, nerves flashed and shorted, like violet sparks above the tramlines. Tempers frayed. The whole city was as pumped up and jittery as a dog being forced to fight.<br><br>Above their heads, loudspeakers strung along the street barked out radio broadcasts of Joseph Goebbels between bursts of military music. Goebbels was cheerleading the nation as though the F�hrer&#x2019;s birthday was synonymous with facing up to the Poles. Enthusiasm for both was compulsory.<br><br>&#x201c;No German at home or anywhere else in the world can fail to take the deepest and heartiest pleasure in participation.&#x201d;<br><br>Clara winced. The voice of the short, clubfooted minister for enlightenment and propaganda still got under her skin like shards of glass. Even now, after six years in Germany, hearing it daily on the radio and at the film studios where she worked, Joseph Goebbels&#x2019;s wheedling tone could make her flinch like chalk screeching on a blackboard.<br><br>Clara was there only because of a solemn promise she had made to her godson, Erich Schmidt, who at sixteen had been chosen to lead his battalion of Hitler Youth in the parade. It was a great honor, he had reminded her numerous times. But from where she was standing there seemed little chance of even glimpsing Erich, let alone of him registering her loyal presence.<br><br>It didn&#x2019;t have to be that way. As an actress contracted to the Ufa studios, Clara had qualified for a place in the VIP enclosure, alongside prominent personalities in their finery and portly Party dignitaries trussed up in field gray. The viewing stand, garlanded with golden laurels and tented drapes like a marquee at a country wedding, offered a far better view and a gilt chair to sit on. That was why she had risked the Ferragamo shoes, as well as the skirt suit and the tip-tilted hat, which now looked far too smart amid the stolid burghers of the Berlin crowd. Only, when she reached the gates of the VIP enclosure, she realized she couldn&#x2019;t face it. She spent enough of her life in close confines with Nazi officials without wanting to join them behind a velvet rope with no chance of escape.<br><br>A frisson of excitement ran through the crowd. A posse of steel-helmeted, black-jacketed SS officers had appeared and were elbowing their way through, glancing from left to right. Joseph Goebbels, who was recording this extravaganza for posterity, was clearly controlling every last detail. No one was allowed to take their own photographs, and police were deputed to arrest anyone in the crowd who wielded a camera or failed to perform the Nazi salute. As the SS men barged past, Clara saw an elderly couple at the back of the throng, the man a teacher or a pastor perhaps, and his gray-haired wife beside him, being hustled off to a side street and lined up against a wall to await the police wagon.<br><br>Mirror periscopes swiveled like reeds in the wind, and the yells around her intensified, rising into a wall of sound. The cordon of SA and SS officers linked arms to prevent the surge of sightseers spilling into the road.<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s coming!&#x201d; The excitement of the moment caused the stolid woman beside Clara to burst into a cry of joy.<br><br>First came a fleet of motorcycle outriders, then Hitler himself, upright at the helm of his seven-liter Mercedes Tourer, with his arm raised in the trademark salute he could apparently hold for two hours straight. His peculiar, impersonal stare traveled like a searchlight across the crowds as his head flicked intermittently right and left, his eyes seemingly seeking out individual faces. Flowers were hurled through the air, hitting the sides of the Mercedes with soft thuds. Surprisingly, only two members of the Adolf Hitler Leibstandarte bodyguard were at the F�hrer&#x2019;s side. The usual car of followers was absent.<br><br>How vulnerable he was. All it would take would be a single shot and the leader of all Germany, the object of all this adulation, would be extinguished like a lightbulb, along with the fears of an entire continent. Clara wondered if she was the only person who had such a thought. German civilians were never told about attempts on the F�hrer&#x2019;s life, but Clara had heard that in Munich several years ago, during a parade like this, a pistol had been found in a newsreel camera mounted on the roof of a car, the barrel of the gun pointed down the lens. Another couple of other assassination attempts had been averted at the last minute. Each lucky escape only served to convince Hitler more firmly of his deepest belief: destiny was on his side.<br><br>As he came parallel to Clara, a shaft of sun lanced through a rent in the clouds, and a finger of light pointed down towards his car. Hitler&#x2019;s bright blue gaze turned in Clara&#x2019;s direction and seemed to penetrate right to where she was standing.<br><br>Clara ducked her head, turned sharply, and pushed her way back through the throng. She had a long day ahead of her and a party to attend that evening. And today of all days she had chosen to move.<br><br>Chapter <br><br>2<br><br>Stepping over the bags she had dumped in the hallway and shrugging off her coat, Clara looked around her new home.<br><br>For an actress working in the Babelsberg studios, just a short distance away through the Berlin forest, this place couldn&#x2019;t be more perfect. It was set in a colony of houses built in the nineteenth century by rich Berliners seeking respite from the city on the bucolic shores of the Griebnitzsee. The villas, all of them by up-and-coming architects, boasted a variety of styles&#x2014;sweet, gabled cottages in the early nineteenth-century Germanic domestic fashion and turreted mock-baronial palaces, alongside modernist constructions with clean lines and open-plan spaces. Since the 1920s, the original owners&#x2014;the bankers and industrialists&#x2014;had given way to film stars, and now the little group of houses was known locally as the Artists&#x2019; Colony. It was Berlin&#x2019;s version of the Hollywood Hills&#x2014;an oasis of luxury just a short drive from the city center for those who could afford privacy and architectural distinction.<br><br>Not a category that included Clara Vine.<br><br>Although her acting contract with Ufa kept her in regular film work, she was far from the heights of stardom that promised a place in the Artists&#x2019; Colony. It might have been her half-English heritage or the rebellious twist to her smile that prevented directors from casting her in leading roles. Or perhaps it was merely that the preferred template for a Reich film star was blond and buxom&#x2014;a pattern fitted perfectly by her friend Ursula Schilling, who had been one of Ufa&#x2019;s top actresses until the previous year, when she joined stars like Marlene Dietrich and Billy Wilder in the sanctuary of Hollywood. This was Ursula&#x2019;s house, and Clara was here only until Ursula decided when, or if, it was safe to return.<br><br>If she didn&#x2019;t know better, Clara might have wondered how Ursula could bear to leave it. Though small, the house, like every other in the Artists&#x2019; Colony, was exquisite in every detail. It had been designed by Mies van der Rohe, with a steep-gabled, red-tiled roof, vanilla-painted fa�ade, and teal-blue shutters on the windows. Beech, oak, and pine trees grew all around, shielding each house from any sight of its neighbor, and giving each dwelling a sense of total rural isolation.<br><br>The front door opened directly into a paneled, open-plan drawing room running the entire length of the house, furnished with bookshelves and a piano. Expensive rugs covered the polished wooden floor, and there was an armchair soft enough to sink into and never get up.<br><br>Ursula had been gone for months now, but the way she had left the house, you would think she had taken a shopping trip to the Kurf�rstendamm rather than an ocean liner across the Atlantic. Everything was still there&#x2014;cushions, lampshades, curtains. The rubble of lotions, stubby kohl pencils, and cratered powders on the dressing table. She had abandoned all her books and furniture, not to mention crockery in the sink and withered rosebuds in a dry vase. Even Ursula&#x2019;s clothes were still in the bedroom, draped carelessly across chairs, falling out of drawers, and hanging in scented layers of silk and satin like gleaming ghosts.<br><br>Fortunately Clara didn&#x2019;t have much luggage of her own. She had always traveled light, ever since her days in repertory theater in England. All she had with her was a few changes of clothes, her leather jewelry box, Max Factor makeup, a book of Rilke&#x2019;s poetry with a duck-egg-blue cover, and the sheaf of mail she had grabbed from her apartment as she left.<br><br>Wandering into the kitchen, she set down a bag containing black rye bread, eggs, potatoes, and an onion. She had stood in line that morning for the eggs and onion and had every intention of enjoying them in an omelet as soon as she had unpacked. As she ran a tap to fill the kettle, she opened a cupboard to rummage for a cup and discovered, with the delight of an archaeologist making an antique find, a gigantic jar of real Melitta coffee beans, shiny nuggets of black gold, almost untouched. The only coffee to be found in Berlin right now, Kaffee-Ersatz, was a gritty concoction of chicory, oats, and roasted barley mixed with chemicals from coal, oil, and tar; so a jar like this was real treasure. Unscrewing the lid, she inhaled greedily. Everyone in Germany obsessed about food now. They dreamed of potatoes fried in butter, crispy chicken, and fragrant roast meat. Of real coffee and cream. Being half English, Clara fantasized about thick wedges of Fuller&#x2019;s walnut cake and solid chunks of Cadbury&#x2019;s chocolate, which were even more impossible to find.</p><h2>American Quilts: The Smithsonian Treasury</h2><p>Presents over sixty quilts from the museum&#39;s collection, and shows examples of the materials and techniques used by American quilters since the eighteenth century</p><p></p><h2>The Mighty Chieftains (American Indians)</h2><p>Discusses the varying role of the chief in Native American cultures, and profiles notable leaders from Metacomet (&#34;King Philip&#34;) through the nineteenth century, including the Apache chiefs, Chief Joseph, and Plenty Coups</p><p><p>Gr 7 Up-The strength of this abundantly illustrated series entry is its approach. The book profiles Native American leaders routinely found in such titles, but rather than the usual account of battles and conflicts with whites, it explains why these individuals became prominent among their respective peoples. Arranged in four chapters roughly by region, the readable narrative flows seamlessly. There are lengthy photo essays between each of the four chapters that cover the nature of leadership in various Indian societies, the impressions of chiefs on their visits to Washington to meet the president, the astounding military strategy of Chief Joseph, and the wise decisions of Plenty Coups during the early reservation years. An extensive bibliography and index are included. The only complaint regarding organization is that readers must go to the index to locate the specific pages on each leader. There are no chapter subheadings or divisions.

Brzezinski (The Grand Failure, 1989, etc.), director of the National Security Council during the Carter Administration, offers an unsparing appraisal of the current century and views the next with considerable skepticism, even trepidation. Looking backward, he accords short shrift to Communism, Nazism, and other totalitarian movements that attempted, at staggering cost, to establish coercive utopias. But while yesteryear's metamyths have been thoroughly discredited, the author remains unconvinced that liberal democracy can fill the resultant vacuums. Indeed, he contends, the West's advanced, affluent societies could forfeit their influence if they don't halt a self-indulgent slide into conspicuous consumption and relativist hedonism. Although the cold war's end has left the planet with but one superpower, Brzezinski insists that America must be guided by globally relevant virtues if it is to exercise authentic authority. In light of the geopolitical instability exacerbated by the Soviet Union's collapse, the author says, America's socioeconomic and cultural woes may undermine its capacity to control events, and, unless the country sets its own house in order (e.g., by forsaking permissiveness and reaffirming bedrock moral values), US ascendancy may be short-lived. Brzezinski identifies regional belligerencies in Eurasia, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, the continuation of the conflicts that pit South against North, and the risk of a fascist renaissance as obstacles to the creation of a consensus that could make the world a comparatively peaceable kingdom.

As usual, she was headed for the kitchen where her mother would be putting out breakfast. But this Saturday was different. </p><p> It was her last Saturday as a single. </p><p> Regan's hand lightly brushed the banister as she reached the bottom step and turned toward the living room. The presents from her bridal shower, held the night before, were neatly stacked in the corner -- everything from the latest and greatest cappuccino machine that Regan was sure she'd never be able to figure out, to a clock radio that blared "Today is the first day of the rest of your life" when the alarm went off. The set of gleaming kitchen knives had intrigued Regan the most. A private investigator, she had examined them closely. The only other present that could have been considered a deadly weapon was the cookbook, her father, Luke, had remarked. </p><p> Luke and Regan's fianc�, Jack "No Relation" Reilly, had escaped to a restaurant in town, and then returned to join the women for an after-dinner drink. All the obligatory oohing and aahing over the household goods and lingerie were mercifully over. Jack's mother, sisters, and aunts were at the shower as well as many of Regan's old family friends. It had been a lively party. </p><p> Regan had flown in two days before from Los Angeles where she had her own PI agency. There was now one week left to finalize all the arrangements before she went from Ms. Reilly to Mrs. Reilly. Today she was heading into New York City with her mother, Nora, and her best friend, Kit, to pick up her wedding gown. </p><p> Getting married is a lot of work, Regan had thought more than once since she'd gotten engaged six months ago. It was easy to see why women turned into Bridezillas. But all the hassle was worth it. Jack was what she had waited for all her life and they both wanted to celebrate with their friends and family by having a large, festive wedding. </p><p> After years of enduring dates with losers, weirdos, and, worst of all, cheapskates, Regan often felt that she would never meet her soul mate. It took her father getting kidnapped for her to find Jack. He was the head of the Major Case Squad in New York City and had worked day and night to get Luke back. In the process, he and Regan had fallen in love. </p><p> At the large butcher block table in the kitchen, Nora and Kit were sipping coffee and munching on blueberry muffins. </p><p> "Good morning," Regan said cheerily. "Kit, I can't believe you're up. We don't have to head into the city for another fifteen minutes." </p><p> "I was sleepless thinking about seeing you in your wedding gown today," Kit said in her usual droll tone. "I never thought the day would arrive. I never thought my day would arrive. Yours did. Mine, I'm sure, never will." </p><p> Regan laughed as Nora cooed sympathetically. "Of course it will." </p><p> "Mom, don't worry about Kit," Regan said as she poured herself a cup of coffee. "Kit, we'll get through everything that this next week entails, get me married off, and then I'm sure we'll be planning your wedding before...before uh..." </p><p> "Before what?" Kit asked as she spread butter on her muffin. "Before the cows come home?" </p><p> "Way before that," Regan answered with a wave of her hand. "Life can change in an instant. I still have a week before I walk down the aisle. Who knows what could happen before then?" </p><p> Nora jumped up, an alarmed expression on her face. "Don't even think like that, Regan. Everything is going to be wonderful. Now let's finish our coffee, get in the car, and drive into the city to pick up the gorgeous dress you will wear one week from today. I must say I'm glad it'll be the last time we have to deal with those crazy designers and that drafty loft they have the nerve to call a bridal salon." </p><p> Regan and Kit looked at each other and laughed. </p><p> "Mom, Charisse and Alfred are a very talented couple and they are starting to make their mark in the fashion world. They're booked a year in advance. I'm glad they were willing to squeeze me in. Pretty soon they're going to be household names." </p><p> None of them could have predicted that Charisse and Alfred's quest for fame would be sped up by their appearance on the front page of the following day's <i>New York Post.</i> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> With Regan at the wheel, Nora's Mercedes-Benz glided into the Holland Tunnel. </p><p> "It's a lovely day," Nora sighed as the sunlight disappeared behind them. "I hope it's like this next Saturday." </p><p> "I do, too. But it's April. You never know..." Regan's voice trailed off. </p><p> "A girl in my office scheduled her wedding for late October on Martha's Vineyard. Wouldn't you know a nor'easter hit that very day? When they got to the reception, the restaurant was without power. And the backup generator had gone kaput," Kit remarked from the backseat. </p><p> "Thanks, Kit." Regan smiled. "I'll be sure to pray for good weather." </p><p> Fifteen minutes later they parked the car in a lot not too far from the heart of Little Italy. Alfred and Charisse's Coutures was located in a loft on the entire third floor of a building that, in Nora's opinion, was in need of a makeover. </p><p> "I don't know what the allure is of places like these," Nora muttered as they walked down a side street that looked like the Broadway set for <i>Cats.</i> </p><p> "People love it down here," Regan commented. "And if you're in fashion, it makes you seem hip to have an address like this. It's where old New York meets the new. The pushcarts of yesteryear have been replaced by trendy boutiques." </p><p> "What's wrong with Madison Avenue?" Nora asked as she stepped over a piece of broken glass on the cracked sidewalk. They stopped in front of an old building and caught the door as a young couple was coming out. Regan held the door open as she pushed the buzzer for Alfred and Charisse's loft. There was no answer. She pushed it again, and they waited. </p><p> Kit looked at her watch. "It's eleven o'clock." </p><p> "I can't imagine where they'd be. They live here and they're expecting us," Regan said. </p><p> "We've already made it through security..." Nora remarked wryly, glancing around at the empty lobby. </p><p> "That we have," Regan agreed. "Let's head upstairs." </p><p> The three of them got on a large, battered, groaning elevator, which took its time about everything. The car slowly ascended to the third floor where it stopped with a jerk. A loud click and a mournful moan followed. After an agonizing six seconds, the door opened. </p><p> Right away Regan could tell something was wrong. The door to the loft was ajar. Whenever she'd been at the salon, Alfred always made a point to keep the door closed. He was paranoid that his genius might float out the door and people would somehow steal the ideas for his designs. Regan hurried across the hall and pushed the door fully open. There was no one in sight. The dress racks were empty. But one lone gown was in shreds on the floor. </p><p> "Charisse?" Regan called. "Alfred?" </p><p> There was no answer. </p><p> Nora grabbed Regan's arm. "Regan, be careful." </p><p> "Charisse?" Regan called again, her voice rising. "Alfred?" She slowly moved farther into the loft and saw that the shredded dress had drops of blood on it. Regan inhaled sharply and hurried to the back of the loft and around the corner to where she knew their bedroom was. Gingerly, Regan opened the door. </p><p> "Oh, my God!" Regan cried. </p><p> Charisse and Alfred were stretched out on their bed, bound and gagged. Regan hurried over and removed Alfred's gag. </p><p> "Regan!" he cried, struggling for breath. "A couple of thieves broke in here in the middle of the night. They tied us up. I thought they were going to kill us. They smashed our safe here in the bedroom and grabbed our cash and jewelry!" </p><p> "They did more than that," Regan said quickly as she ran around the bed and untied the cloth around Charisse's mouth. "It looks like all your dresses are gone. Except one that could use a lot of help." </p><p> Two screams pierced the air: One belonged to Alfred. The other emanated from the owner of that sorry bridal gown who had just arrived in the next room. </p><p> Regan couldn't decide whose scream was worse. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> Copyright � 2006 by Carol Higgins Clark</p></p><h2>Lotta&#39;s Easter Surprise</h2><p>Lotta gives the Easter Bunny a helping hand when all the candy stores close early.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Introduction: Swedish"The candy store has closed, and since the Easter bunny always bought his eggs there (so Mom and Dad say), there can't be an egg hunt.

Vanilla, of which there are about 100 varieties, is the only species of Orchidace� of any culinary significance. The most important variety, <i>V. planifolia</i>, is a tropical climbing orchid, its succulent 1/3 - 1/4 in. (1-2 cm) diameter stems reach 33 - 49 ft. (10-15 in) high by clinging to host trees with long aerial roots. The leaves are flat, fleshy and large, ranging from 31/4-10 in. (8-25 cm) long and 3/4 - 3 1/4 in. (2-8 cm) wide. They are rounded at the base and taper abruptly to a 'cow-lick' pointed tip. The slightly fragrant, pale-greenish flower is yellow-lipped and averages 3 1/4 - 4 in. (8-10 cm) in diameter. The almost cylindrical, angled 4-10 in. (10-25 cm) long capsules that follow, hang in clusters and are referred to as pods or beans. When fresh they have no aroma or taste, it is the cured vanilla beans that are the source of true vanilla flavor. </p><p> There are two other varieties of vanilla, however their flavor is inferior when compared to <i>V. planifolia</i>. West Indian vanilla resembles <i>V. planifolia</i> but has larger leaves and flowers and shorter, thicker pods. Tahitian vanilla is native to Tahiti and cultivated in Hawaii, it has slender stems, narrow leaves and small pods that taper at either end. </p><p> A cured vanilla bean is dark brown to black in color, averages 7 - 8 in. (18-20 cm) long, has a shriveled appearance with many longitudinal ridges and indentations and is as flexible as a strip of well-oiled bridle leather. A dusting of white, sugary powder known as <i>givre</i> sometimes appears on the surface; this is <i>vanillin</i> (the active ingredient responsible for vanilla's flavor) which has crystallized. When split lengthwise, a black sticky mass of millions of minute seeds is revealed, each one being no larger than a speck of ground black pepper. The aroma of a vanilla bean is fragrant, floral, sweet and highly agreeable. Similarly, its taste is rich, smooth and appealing, although the flavor can only be fully appreciated in tandem with its seductive smell. </p><p><b> Origin and History </b></p><p> Vanilla is indigenous to the south-east of Mexico and parts of Central America where it grows in well-drained soils that are high in humus from the surrounding tropical vegetation. Although it is not known when the Aztecs started using vanilla, its production had reached some degree of sophistication by the time the Spanish were introduced to it in a drink of chocolate and vanilla sweetened with honey, that was given to Cort�s by the Aztec emperor Montezuma in 1520. So impressed were the Spanish with this discovery that they imported vanilla beans and established factories in Spain to manufacture chocolate flavored with vanilla. The flavor of vanilla was not its only attribute as it had apparently earned a reputation as a nerve stimulant, an aphrodisiac and was also used to scent tobacco. Although plants were taken to England as early as 1733, and were re-introduced at the beginning of the nineteenth century, all serious attempts to have them produce pods outside their natural habitat had failed. It was not until the middle of the nineteenth century that the reason for this barrenness, due to the absence of natural pollinators, was discovered and thus a satisfactory method of hand pollination developed. By the early twentieth century, vanilla was cultivated in Reunion, Tahiti, and parts of Africa and Madagascar. </p><p> Sadly the invention of artificial vanilla from the waste sulphite liqueur of paper nulls, coal tar extracts or <i>eugenol</i> (the oil from cloves) nearly ruined the natural vanilla industry. Imitation vanilla was about one-tenth of the price of real vanilla and although inferior in flavor profile, accounted for the lion's share of vanilla flavoring used in the burgeoning global market for ice-cream, confectionery and beverages. By the end of the twentieth century, consumer demand for natural flavors and an appreciation for the superior nuances in the flavor of real vanilla, has seen some resurgence in the Mexican industry as well as creating opportunities for new producers such as India and Indonesia. </p><p><b> Processing </b></p> The production of vanilla is an extraordinarily labor intensive process, beginning with fertilizing the flowers, which has to be done by hand to ensure a good crop. This is because the flowers are pollinated in their natural habitat by little bees of the genus <i>Melapona</i>. There are either not enough of these bees around to pollinate the vanilla flowers or the vines may be growing in regions where these bees do not exist. To complicate things further, there is a small membrane in the vanilla flower that prevents the stigma and stamen from touching and pollinating. Therefore the painstaking process of bending the two filaments to touch (generally done with a small implement like a toothpick) has to be done to every flower in the plantation to ensure it produces a vanilla bean. <p></p><p> The successfully fertilized flowers produce pods in about six weeks, and six to nine months after pollination the green pods begin to turn yellow at the bottom tip, indicating they are ready for harvest. We were intrigued when visiting a vanilla plantation in Papantla in south-eastern Mexico, to learn that owing to the high value of vanilla beans, they were often stolen by bandits just before the harvest. The farmers we saw said this had been a big problem for them in the past, however the bandits were often caught because of the practice of literally branding each vanilla bean! Difficult to imagine as it is, they did brand each green bean, using a cork with some pins in it forming a pattern. This pattern was 'branded' onto every bean and it stayed there and even remained after curing. </p><p> You will have noticed that most vanilla beans are uniform in length and look quite straight. On the plantation we visited, the farmer removes any curved pods, leaving only the good straight ones to mature. As the vanilla pods don't all mature at the same time the harvest can take place over a period of about three months. The pods are picked and then taken into town where they are cured. The harvested green, tasteless beans are laid in boxes and put into a wood-fired kiln to start the drying and curing process in which enzymes naturally occurring in vanilla create <i>vanillin</i>. After about 24 hours in the kiln the vanilla beans are spread out in the sun to absorb heat, becoming so hot you would almost burn your fingers if you picked one up. At the end of the day the pods are gathered up and wrapped in blankets or straw mats and laid out to sweat on multi-tiered racks in a large shed that is protected from the weather. The vanilla beans go through this process on a rotational basis and are then stored for up to six months until they have turned a very dark brown or black and the head curer is satisfied that the curing process is complete. During this time a vanilla bean may have been handled 100 times or more, and what commenced as five kilos of green, uncured beans becomes one kilo of properly cured vanilla beans. The beans are then graded according to quality and strung together in tight bundles of 60-100 pods ready for export. Although one may think no job could be more pleasant than working with vanilla all day long, vanilla workers hav</p></p><h2>Cook&#39;s Country Best Potluck Recipes</h2><p>Whether you&#39;re feeding your extended family on a Sunday night or heading over to the neighbor&#39;s annual block party, Cook&#39;s Country comes to the rescue with an impressive collection of recipes offering dishes fit for every kind of crowd.</p><p></p><h2>After Race: Racism After Multiculturalism</h2><p>After Race pushes us beyond the old &#34;race vs. class&#34; debates to delve deeper into the structural conditions that spawn racism.

With the world at war, directors served up propaganda and escapist entertainment to the massed moviegoers of the pre-television age. Yet in many countries, there was also a parallel tendency towards greater realism. In Italy, for example, the spirit of the resistance culminated in the neorealist movement, which inspired the world&#39;s moviemakers with masterpieces such as De Sica&#39;s Bicycle Thieves (1948). In Hollywood, the 40s were probably the most creative phase in the studios? history. Never before had the Dream Factory brought such compellingly edgy and experimental films to the silver screen. The most seminal work of the decade was Citizen Kane (1941); Orson Welles&#39;s extravagantly original debut anticipated the expressive visual style that would come to typify film noir?the genre of ?dark movies, ? populated by romantic antiheroes and femmes fatales, that still represents the essence of cinema for many passionate movie buffs. In the atmospheric black-and-white universe of noir, Rita Hayworth, Ava Gardner, and Lauren Bacall became timeless erotic icons, while Bogart?following The Big Sleep (1945)?was the very quintessence of cool. While these movies bore witness to the cracks in America&#39;s fa?ade, another genre was busily reconstituting the nation&#39;s identity. In the films of John Ford, the Western came back with a vengeance, Monument Valley embodied America&#39;s incomparable grandeur, and John Wayne (The Duke) was a natural aristocrat of the wild frontier.</p><p>The editor: J�rgen M�ller studied art history in Bochum, Paris, Pisa, and Amsterdam.

Beginning in ancient Spain, where Hannibal's father had carved out a Carthaginian empire, the novel traces the origins of the war, the opening moves, and Hannibal's inspired choice to attack Rome via a land route most believed impossible. In graphic, panoramic prose, Durham describes the battles, including the icy slaughter of the Trebia; the mist-shrouded battle along Lake Trasimene; the battle of Cannae, in which Hannibal's outnumbered force surrounded and decimated seventy thousand Romans in a single afternoon; and Zama, the hard slog that proved to be the decisive contest. <br>Along the way we meet a variety of major historical figures on both sides of the conflict, as well as characters representing the vast array of other ethnicities who played a part in the war: Iberians and Gauls, Numidians and Libyans, Macedonians and Moors. Hannibal's family is brought to life: his wife, mother, sisters, and young son, as is Publius Scipio, the young Roman who was the only match for Hannibal's genius on the field of battle &#x2014; and who eventually defeated him. <br><i>Pride of Carthage</i> is a stunning achievement in historical fiction, one that will transport readers to a world of mesmerizing authenticity of character, event, and detail.</p></p><p><p><b>DAVID ANTHONY DURHAM</b> earned an MFA from the University of Maryland and is the author of two widely praised novels, <i>Gabriel&#x2019;s Story</i> and <i>Walk Through Darkness</i>. Durham lives in Massachusetts with his wife and children.</p><b>One</b><br><br><i>Prelude</i><br>The delegation arrived in the capital of the Roman Republic during the waning days of the Mediterranean autumn. They had traveled from the city of Saguntum in eastern Iberia to beg an audience before the Senate. Once they were granted it, a man named Gramini spoke for them. He looked about the chamber with a clear-eyed visage, voice strong but somewhat lispy. The Romans had to crane forward on their benches and watch his lips to understand him, some with hands cupped to their ears, a few with grimaces and whispers that the man's Latin was unintelligible. But in the end all understood the substance of his words, and that was this: The Saguntines were afraid. They feared for their very existence. They were a jewel embedded in a rough land, rife with tribal conflict and turmoil. They were sheep living with a mighty wolf at their back. The creature's name was not new to them, for it was the ever hungry Hannibal Barca of Carthage, the son of Hamilcar, avowed enemy of Rome.<br><br>The delegate explained that Rome had neglected Iberia to the Republic's detriment. The African power had taken advantage of this to build an empire there. It had grown into a stronger foe than it had ever been during their earlier wars. He wondered aloud whether Romans had forgotten the lessons of history. Did they not remember the damage Hamilcar Barca had inflicted upon them during the last war between Rome and Carthage? Did they deny that he had gone undefeated and that the conflict had been decided by the flaws of others beyond his control? Did they remember that after this reversal Hamilcar had not only prevailed over the mercenary revolt in his own country but had also begun carving into Iberian soil? Because of him, the Carthaginians grew even richer on a harvest of silver and slaves and timber, a fortune that flowed daily into the coffers of their homeland.<br><br>By the benevolent will of the gods, Hamilcar had been dead some years now, but his son-in-law, Hasdrubal the Handsome, had stretched their domain farther and built a fortress-city at New Carthage. Now he, too, was dead: Thankfully, an assassin's knife had found his throat as he slept. But Hamilcar had been resurrected in his son Hannibal. He had set about completing their mission. Altogether, the three Carthaginians had defeated the Olcades and destroyed their city of Althaea, punished the Vaccaei and captured Salmantica, and made unrelenting war on the tribes of the Baetis and Tagus and even the Durius, peoples wilder and farther removed than those of Saguntum. Even now, Hannibal was off on a new campaign against Arbocala. If this proved successful&#x2014;as the emissaries feared it might have already&#x2014;most of Iberia would lie under the Carthaginian heel. There was only one great city left, and that was Saguntum. And was Saguntum not an ally to Rome? A friend to be called upon in ill times and likewise aided in Rome's own moments of calamity? That is why he was here before them, to ask for Rome's full commitment of support should Hannibal set his sights next on them.<br><br>The senator Gaius Flaminius rose to respond. A tall man among Romans, Gaius was self-assured beneath a bristle of short black hair that stood straight up from his forehead as if plastered there with egg whites. He joked that the Saguntines could not be mistaken for sheep. They were a mighty people in their own right. Their fortress was strong and their resilience in battle well known. He also added, a bit more dryly, that there was one wolf of the Mediterranean and it resided not in Iberia but upon the Tiber. He did not answer the Iberians' questions directly but thanked them for their faith and urged patience. The Senate would consider the matter.<br><br>Gramini bowed at this answer but showed with his upraised hand that he was not yet finished. He wanted it understood that the danger Saguntum was in related to its allegiance with Rome. Should that allegiance prove to be of no substance, then a grave injustice would have been committed against a blameless people. Saguntum had every intention of staying loyal to Rome. He hoped that Rome would likewise honor its commitment, for there were some who claimed Saguntum was foolish to put so much faith in a Latin alliance. He ended by asking, "Can we have your word, then, of direct military assistance?"<br><br>"You have yet to be attacked," Flaminius said. "It would be unwise to conclude a course of action prior to understanding the nature of the conflict." He assured the Iberian that in any event the Saguntines should return to Iberia in good spirits. No nation had ever regretted, or would ever regret, making a friend of Rome.<br><br>Having received this answer, Gramini retired and was soon making the arrangements for his return voyage. The Senate, for their part, did engage with the questions the Iberian had posed, in depth, in heated debate, that afternoon and all of the next. They agreed to send a messenger to this Carthaginian, Hannibal Barca. Let his cage get a good rattling. Let him remember the power of Rome and act accordingly. Beyond this, however, they could come to no firm consensus. They had other foreign issues to deal with, in Gaul and Illyria. The resolution of this affair with Carthage would have to wait.<br>Each afternoon since arriving in Iberia two weeks earlier, the youngest of the Barca brothers, Mago, had taken a long, vigorous ride through the countryside. On returning each afternoon he paused at the same vantage point and stared at the physical manifestation of his family's legacy. New Carthage was breathtaking. It sat at the far end of a long isthmus, like an island tacked to the continent by an arm of the land that refused to let go. From a distance its walls rose straight up out of the water on three sides, only that narrow stretch of earth connecting it to the continent. The harbor carved an almost perfect circle around the city, with fingers of jutting rock that all but closed its mouth. Two thirds of its water sank into a blue-black no different from the deep water offshore; the other third, on the south side of the city, shone a wonderful turquoise blue, lit from below by a shallow bed of rock and coral that caught the sun like the inside of an oyster shell.<br><br>The fifteenth time he took in this view, he knew something had changed. It was a minute detail and he took a moment to spot it: The flag normally flapping above the citadel had been pulled in. No longer did the red standard of campaign snap in the breeze. Now, even as he watched, a new flag climbed into position. It shivered, curled, trembled, and never stood out clearly, but he knew what it was: the Lion of Carthage. His family's symbol. It meant his brothers had returned from the insurrection they had gone to put down in the north. Messengers had brought word of the army's approach earlier in the week, but they must have made better time than anticipated.<br><br>A rider sent out to find him met him near the southern gates to the fortress. Hannibal asked that he come without hesitation, the messenger said. When Mago dismounted and headed toward the palace the man said, "Not there. Please follow me."<br><br>The walk took a further few minutes. The messenger led him at a trot across the main courtyard, down several flights of marble stairs, through a series of tunnels, and then up a sloping ramp onto the wall itself. Beyond it, Mago caught sight of the returning army, coming in from the northern approach. His steps slowed as he took it in. <br><br>The long, wide column flowed over the rolling landscape, receding into the distance and still visible on the farthest ridge of the horizon. The infantry marched in loose formation, in their respective companies and tribal affiliations. The cavalry rode out to either side of the army. They circled and wheeled and galloped in short bursts, as if they were herdsmen at work with a great flock. The elephants strode in a similar deployment but spaced at larger intervals. He could see the nearest of them in detail. They were of the African breed, so their drivers straddled them just behind their ears. The riders' heads and torsos swayed with the slow rhythm of the creatures' strides. They talked to their mounts and smacked them with rods, but these seemed automatic gestures, for the creatures saw the fortress and could already smell the feed waiting for them.<br><br>Mago turned and sped off behind the messenger, pushing his way through a growing, joyous crowd. He had to move quickly to slip between them. By the time the messenger slowed his pace and looked back at Mago, they had again dropped down to the base level of the city. They walked down a dark hallway. It was rank with moisture, cooler than the exposed air. Old hay had been swept out and piled along one side of the corridor. The acidic bite of urine made Mago walk with his head turned to one side. He was about to ask the messenger which this was&#x2014;a joke or a mistake&#x2014;but then caught sight of a head glancing out from a room toward the end of the hallway. A body emerged after it: his older brother, Hanno, the second after Hannibal. Mago pushed past the messenger and jogged toward him, arms upraised for the greeting he expected.<br><br>Hanno shot one arm out. His fingers clamped around his brother's bicep and squeezed a momentary greeting. But then that was done with. He pulled Mago's eyes to his own and fixed his lips in a stern line. "Romans," he said. "They arrived just before us. Not the homecoming we expected. Hannibal is just about to speak with them. Come."<br><br>Hanno motioned for his brother to enter the room behind him. Though swept clean of straw and filth, the room was simply a corridor, lined along one wall with stalls. It was lit by a mixture of torchlight and the slanting gray daylight from a passage that opened onto the horse-training fields. Several soldiers of the Sacred Band lined the walls. These were guards sworn to protect the nation's generals. Each was clean-shaven on the cheeks and upper lip, a carefully trimmed knob of whiskers at the base of his chin.

He has since moved the store (just across the street) and ambitiously expanded it. A nationally recognized cheese expert, Rob has appeared on the Food Network and has been profiled in <i>The New Yorker</i>. He lives in New York City.<b>INTRODUCTION<br></b><br>I've always loved cheese, but I didn&#x2019;t become passionate about it until I became a customer at Murray&#x2019;s myself back in 1989. If I think back to my earliest cheese memories, they are not about eating the perfect Piave in Italy. They are about growing up eating cheeseburgers and grilled cheese sandwiches in Highland Park, New Jersey, and about Mom cooking Dad those big, puffy, brown cheese omelets on a Sunday with Swiss or Cheddar.<br><br>Almost everybody loves cheese and has some favorites. The magic is that you can go on discovering cheese almost forever; there are thousands of different cheeses from all over the world. The most amazing thing about them all is that the three main ingredients remain the same&#x2014;milk, rennet, and salt&#x2014;and yet the tastes, textures, and appearance are infinite in their variety. It's amazing, too, that cheese has been made the same way continuously for thousands of years.<br><br>I don&#x2019;t think my love of cheese is distinguishable from the idea of buying something uniquely delicious and perfectly ripened from an old shop in an old neighborhood, and that&#x2019;s the experience I want all my customers to have in the new Murray&#x2019;s.<br><br>When I first became a customer at the old Murray&#x2019;s, one of the things I liked best about it, and still do, is that it is the oldest cheese shop in New York. As I write this, in October 2005, Murray&#x2019;s is celebrating its sixty&#x2013;fifth anniversary. It may have moved three times, but it's traveled only twenty-five feet from the original shop in all that time.<br><br>I never met the original owner, Murray Greenberg; he died before I got here. He was an Eastern European Spanish Civil War veteran, and when he came to America in 1940 he opened a wholesale butter and egg shop a few doors up Cornelia Street. Despite his communist leanings, I've been told he was a street&#x2013;smart capitalist who used to buy cheese cheap, trim it up, and sell it.<br><br>In the 1970s, he finally sold the shop to his clerk, Louis Tudda, an Italian immigrant from Calabria, who filled the shop not just with cheese but also with cheap olive oil and tomatoes, which he sold mostly to his local Italian neighbors. That&#x2019;s the way it was when I bought the shop fifteen years ago in 1991. So what made me buy it and give up everything for cheese? I had left the family supermarket business in 1985 to work in full-service specialty shops in New Jersey, where I was from. When my second shop in Princeton tanked with the crash of &#x2019;87, I found myself in my brother&#x2019;s place here in the Village, wondering what I should do with my life next.<br><br>One day I was standing in line at the original Murray&#x2019;s, and I heard Louis say he&#x2019;d lost his lease and was closing. I made him several offers he refused, but eventually made a deal. I moved the shop to the corner of Bleecker, and that&#x2019;s where it remained for fourteen years, until November 2004.<br><br>Frankie Meilak, who had worked for Louis for six years, came with the shop. He is still here with me. He lived up the street and stayed on when his parents moved back home to Malta. Louis stayed on for a year before he went back home.<br><br>One day around ten years ago, Cielo Peralta walked into the shop and announced he was coming to work for me. I told him I didn&#x2019;t have a job for him. He took absolutely no notice, strode right past me straight into the shop, put on an apron, and started selling cheese, saying I didn&#x2019;t have to pay him unless I liked his work. I only had to see Cielo behind the counter for a day to know he&#x2019;d sell twelve times more cheese than anyone else. In fact, he&#x2019;s probably sold more specialty cheese than anyone else in the United States. He&#x2019;s still here, too.<br><br>When I arrived at Murray&#x2019;s we were selling around 100 different cheeses. We&#x2019;ve gone from 100 to 250 on the counter at any one time, but with our seasonal calendar and promotions, our range is probably somewhere around 500 to 600 cheeses.<br><br>We started broadening our selection in the early nineties, a time of explosive interest in U.S. and foreign artisanal food. Our original American purveyors (pioneer women) had started making cheese&#x2014;like Mary Keehn&#x2019;s Humboldt Fog and Cindy Major&#x2019;s Vermont Shepherd&#x2014;in the seventies and eighties. There were cheeses from places with no tradition of cheesemaking, or where the tradition had been nearly lost and where it began anew. I got involved in American farmstead cheeses first through the American Cheese Society, whose headquarters in those days were around the corner from the shop on Downing Street.<br><br>I think the first real specialty cheese we got from abroad came from Neal&#x2019;s Yard Dairy in England in the early 1990s. After that, I went to Spain, Italy, France, Ireland, and England searching out small dairies and new cheeses, but I still thought the growing popularity and appetite for cheese was probably a fad; I didn&#x2019;t know it was going to turn into a lasting trend.<br><br>My father thought buying Murray&#x2019;s was a really stupid idea. We were at the peak of the low&#x2013;fat, cholesterol&#x2013;obsessed days, and there was clearly no expectation from him, as an experienced grocer, or from me, that cheese was going to become the Next Big Thing. It&#x2019;s only in the last couple of years that artisanal cheese has penetrated the consciousness of a broader market in the U.S.<br><br>In the beginning, I got into cheese because I wanted a nice little old&#x2013;fashioned business like the one in the picture hanging over my dairy case. It shows my grandfather's shop in Perth Amboy, New Jersey, in 1925. My grandfather Irving with his wife, Fanny, and his brother Murray with his wife, Bessie, and their two small children, are all sitting on the stoop in front. Buying Murray's was a romantic notion. There had always been a line when I went there as a customer, so I thought it was conceivable that I could lead a Greenwich Village life, pay the rent and buy groceries, and take my place in that long family tradition. I also liked the fact we&#x2019;re on Bleecker Street, because I grew up listening to Bob Dylan and Dave Van Ronk. Van Ronk turned out to be a Murray&#x2019;s customer and gave me guitar lessons before he died.<br><br>I like the idea of being a small business and of buying from small businesses. The cheesemakers I deal with love what they're doing, are passionate about making cheese, and are peculiar, quirky oddballs, like I am. I also don&#x2019;t have to wear a suit and tie!<br><br>I love the creative aspect of merchandising food. I believe coming to Murray's should be an entertaining experience; it&#x2019;s fun, it&#x2019;s funky, it&#x2019;s exciting. My favorite food-buying experiences have been in the markets in European villages and towns, where everything is simple and direct. The food is abundantly on display, and you often buy from the producer directly. The transaction has a theatrical element to it: The sellers are onstage and you, the customer, are the audience.<br><br>One of the things I always liked best about Murray's was that the people behind the counter would explain cheese to the customers without making them feel like they were idiots. The truth is, if we educate the customers, suggest new things, tempt them with ever more delicious cheeses, and let them taste things over the counter, they'll enjoy cheese even more and buy more of it. That may be one of the oldest traditions in retail, but it's the one that's nearly been killed in our chain-store age.<br><br>So I wrote this book to tell you all about cheese, to pass on my passion.<br><br>Here are my favorite three hundred or so cheeses out of the thousands I've tasted. I hope you will sit down with a glass of wine, a hunk of good cheese, and this book, and savor all three. This guide is designed so you can easily consult it, dipping into various sections for useful and practical information. And when you&#x2019;re in the neighborhood, stop by Murray&#x2019;s and let us look after you. Cheese is my job and my passion, and what more can I say about my work than that, fifteen years later, I still can't wait to taste another new cheese.<br><b>HOW TO USE THIS HANDBOOK<br></b><br>Each cheese is followed by a quick and simple overview of its key characteristics: milk type, country of origin, raw versus pasteurized, type, vegetarian, and controlled designation of origin.<br><b>MILK TYPE</b><br><br>First off, we'll tell you if a cheese is:<br>Water buffalo<br>Cow<br>Goat<br>Sheep<br>Mixed (and which blend)<br><br>Most commonly seen are cheeses made from goat&#x2019;s, cow&#x2019;s, and sheep&#x2019;s milk. Some cheeses are made from water buffalo milk. Others are a mixture of two or more milk types. The type of milk affects the flavor, texture, and character of a cheese. It&#x2019;s difficult to make generalizations, but we comfortably claim the following.<br><br>Goat&#x2019;s milk has less fat and tends to taste lighter and fresher. Also, it&#x2019;s often made into lightly aged styles that have a fresh, tangy taste.<br><br>Cows make the most milk, and you&#x2019;ll see the greatest variety of type, texture, and flavor in cow&#x2019;s&#x2013;milk cheeses. They account for the majority of cheese (just check out the index by milk type).<br><br>Sheep have the fattiest milk, which translates into rich, hearty cheese, even if it's aged and drier in texture. You feel the fat.<br><br>Buffalo, goat, and sheep milk are most likely to have &#x201c;barny&#x201d; or &#x201c;gamy&#x201d; flavors, like rare meat.<br><b>COUNTRY OF ORIGIN</b><br><br>Maybe you&#x2019;re a Francophile, or planning to visit the Basque country. Perhaps you have a passion for all things Italian, or you&#x2019;ve got a recipe that calls for something Swiss. Knowing where a cheese originates may not guarantee a specific eating experience, but it&#x2019;s always a good idea to have that information.<br><br>Specific types of cheese are often typical of certain regions. That&#x2019;s no surprise if you consider that the climate and types of animals raised are consistent within a given area. Our descriptions will always point you to the region of production.<br><b>RAW VERSUS PASTEURIZED</b><br><br>Cheese may be made from milk that is either raw or pasteurized; some cheeses are available in both raw and pasteurized versions. Things to note:<br><br>� In the United States, all cheese that is less than sixty days old must, by law, be made from pasteurized milk. This is true for both imported and domestically produced cheese. Under sixty days = pasteurized.<br><br>�&nbsp;In the United States, doctors typically recommend that pregnant women avoid raw milk cheese, though this is not necessarily the case in Europe.<br><br>� We find that pasteurization often results in a cheese that has less flavor and a gummier texture. That said, many pasteurized cheeses, such as Stilton, have superb flavor.<br><br>� For more on raw milk and pasteurization (and what we really think), see Frequently Asked Questions.<br><b>TYPE</b><br><br>Different books break down cheeses into various types, styles, or families. We have divided our handbook into seven types that we find clear and simple to understand:<br><br>� Fresh<br>� Bloomy<br>� Washed Rind<br>� Semisoft<br>� Firm<br>� Hard<br>� Blue<br><br>These types are about more than texture or cheesemaking approach. They're about a group of cheeses that provide a consistent eating experience. We&#x2019;re guessing the technical stuff is secondary to your interest in finding a cheese you like. Our types will help you do that.<br><b>Fresh</b><br>Think:&nbsp; Young. Tart. Tangy. Lemony. Smooth. Moist. Creamy.

Complex.<br>Find:&nbsp; Gorgonzola, Roquefort, Stilton<br><b>VEGETARIAN</b><br><br>A cheese may be considered vegetarian if, during cheesemaking, curds were coagulated with a non&#x2013;animal substance. To our knowledge, this is the first resource to identify the cheeses of the world by coagulant.<br><br>For more on this distinction, see Frequently Asked Questions.<br><b>CONTROLLED DESIGNATION OF ORIGIN<br></b><br>Various European countries bestow the honor &#x201c;controlled designation of origin&#x201d; on foodstuffs of the highest quality, often produced using traditional methods, and usually reflecting a unique environment that promotes distinctive flavor characteristics. In France, this protection is the A.O.C. (Appellation d&#x2019;Origine Controlee). In Italy, it is the D.O.P. (Denominazione di Origine Protetta). For Portugal, it&#x2019;s D.O.P. (Denominacao de Origem Protegida). In Spain, the term is D.O. (Denominacion de Origen).<br><br>Knowing that a cheese has a controlled designation of origin won&#x2019;t necessarily tell you what it will taste like, but it guarantees the following:<br><br>Origin: The milk is produced and the cheese is made in a precise geographical area (e.g., the town of Meaux).<br><br>Tradition: Traditional cheesemaking methods (such as burying a cheese in the ground or producing only during certain months) may go back thousands of years and produce the unique &#x201c;recipe&#x201d; for that cheese.<br><br>Character: The typical characteristics of each cheese, such as shape, size, rind, texture, and minimum fat content, may be regulated.<br><br>Authenticity: The governing country guarantees authenticity and quality: Producers submit to approval by a commission.<br><br>American cheesemaking has no equivalent control at this time. Domestic farmstead cheeses are produced by single farms, rather than co&#x2013;ops or groups, which means identification of the producer is essential. Thus, in this guide, all American cheeses are listed first by producer and second by cheese name.<br><br>Some of the most famous cheeses in the world do not benefit from &#x201c;controlled designation of origin&#x201d; protection. This, unfortunately, is why a divine raw cow&#x2019;s&#x2013;milk wheel from a single farm in Somerset, England, and a plastic-wrapped slice of industrial &#x201c;cheese food&#x201d; from origins unknown may both be deemed &#x201c;Cheddar.&#x201d;<br><br>We won't swear that every &#x201c;controlled designation of origin&#x201d; cheese will be good, but it does promote consistency, because all cheeses with the same name must subscribe to the same regulations. It also suggests that you'll be eating a unique piece of a country&#x2019;s culture, history, and tradition.</p><h2>Giggle, Giggle, Quack (A Click, Clack Book)</h2><p>The sequel to the <i>New York Times </i>and Caldecott Honor&#x2013;winning <i>Click, Clack, Moo</i> is now available as a Level 2 Ready-to-Read!<br><br>Farmer Brown is going on vacation.

But not to worry--he's leaving his brother Bob to mind the farm: "I wrote everything down for you. Just follow my instructions and everything will be fine. But keep an eye on Duck. He's trouble." Of course, fans of Doreen Cronin and Betsy Lewin's last brilliant book already know to keep an eye on that manipulative mallard. Now, wait a minute... what's Duck doing eyeing that pencil?<p> Poor Bob has no idea what he's in for, and Duck and friends have shrewdly seized this chance to move on from collective bargaining to outright subterfuge: "Bob gave Duck a good long stare and went inside. He read the first note: 'Tuesday night is pizza night (not the frozen kind!). The hens prefer anchovies.'" Well, seems like strange way to run a farm, but... "Twenty-nine minutes later there was hot pizza in the barn." Giggle, giggle, quack, indeed.</p><p> Clearly, Duck and his cow pals aren't the only ones around to have mastered the pencil and the keyboard. Cronin and Lewin have put their talents to good use yet again, offering up another simple but clever story fit for kids and grownups alike. Lewin seems to snicker throughout her playful watercolors (gotta love those monogrammed towels: "FB"), and Cronin has a ball with the animal cast and their human patsy.

She swung her tar feet under the vinyl chair as she stacked large, empty Ohio Blue Tip matchboxes the old woman had saved for her into a pyramid on the kitchen table. Throughout the house, scraps of paper, Scotch-taped reminders, littered the walls. Cardboard boxes sat nestled like hungry mouths of birds wide open for wrapped tumblers, cutlery, souvenir ashtrays. Bulk-filled pillowcases leaned against the coffee table, tagged by the old woman with words so scratchy they could have been written by the same needle used to pin the notes to the pillowcases: <b>cobijas</b>, one note said; <b>Cosa del ba�o</b>, said another. <b>No good dreses. Josie's tipewriter. Fotos.</b> The child swung her feet as she stacked sixteen then eight then four then two then one hollow matchbox until the shadows lengthened in the kitchen. Before the lightbulb had to be switched on, before the old woman Chavela ordered, Go home now, listen to me, it's getting late. </p><p> Chavela continued packing tin cans from the pantry into a box on a chair opposite the child. The old woman was toothpick-splintery like her writing. Her hands trembled from the onset of Parkinson's. Rhubarbs faded from the print of her housedress. She padded across the kitchen wearing neatly folded-down cotton socks and a pair of terry-cloth slippers. She barely whooshed the air whenever she passed the child. </p><p> Are you deaf? It's getting late. Chavela's croaky words floated from a distant place to the child's ears like yanked strands of seaweed beached on the shore. The child held a matchbox in midair and looked at the greenish flame flicker under the iron comal and waited for the old woman to say something else. The chair was hard, lumpy and stuck to the child's thighs. Chavela shook out a cigarette from a cellophane package, propped it between her stitched crunch of lips, grabbed a matchbox and shook it, rattled another, then another in search of matchsticks until she had scattered the pyramid about the table. </p><p> Chavela waxed the shiny temples of her forehead with her tobacco-tarnished hand. The child could see the milky film of her eyes scanning around the kitchen in search of matchsticks and finally the old woman said, It's not right, I'm telling you. Chavela raised the flame on the stove and hunched over the spurting fire under the comal. The heat splashed on her face and then she lowered the gas, inhaled and coughed and returned her gold bunched package to the pocket of her rhubarb dress. </p><p> The child had dreamt of lizards, and it was because of the dream that she had listened to the smaller Gamboa boy, who had caught a tiny lizard from a mound of bulldozed earth. The earthmovers, Grandmother Zumaya had called them; the bulldozers had started from very far away and slowly arrived on First Street, their muzzles like sharpened metal teeth making way for the freeway. The Gamboa boy had hidden behind her grandfather's toolshed, and psssted at the child to join him. His face tar-smudged, he held it and at first the lizard clawed the thin air. In his other hand, the Gamboa boy held a pair of rusty scissors. He reassured her that the tail would grow back. It's not right, she knew, even if they witnessed a miracle. The lizard turned to stone, stiff and silent. They both waited. He made her touch it and then he made her touch the rings of wrinkled skin. The cold sensation never left her fingers, his clamp around her wrist as he pulled her behind the toolshed never left her, his dirty rough clasp where the lizard's head poked in and out never left her. That feeling -- it's not right -- never left her. </p><p> The old woman had taped scribbled instructions all over the walls of the house. <b>Leve massage for Josie. Basura on Wetsday. J work # AN 54389.</b> I need to remember, Chavela had told the child when the child pointed a matchbox at the torn pieces of papers clinging on the walls. <b>Water flours. Pepto Bismo. Chek gas off.</b> It's important to remember my name, my address, where I put my cigarillo down <b>Call Josie. Chavela Luz Ybarra de Cortez. SS#010-56-8336. 4356 East 1st</b> or how the earthquake cracked mi tierra firme, mi pa�s, now as far away as my youth, a big boom-crack. The dogs and gente went crazy from having the earth pulled out right from under them. <b>Cal Mr...Lencho's tio sobre apartment. Shut off luz.</b> The earthquake's rubble of wood and clay and water yielded only what was missing; shoes without shoelaces, flowered curtains without windows, a baby rattle without seeds in its hollow belly, an arm without a body; and how the white smell of burnt flesh choked. <b>J work # AN 54389. Smoke outside.</b> That's why I began to smoke cigarettes, to hide the white smell even over here in El Norte, even after seventy-seven years, so don't complain about my cigarillos. </p><p> But Chavela forgot to smoke her cigarettes outside and the tobacco made the child's nose itch. She smoked in front of the kitchen sink where the linoleum floor was scuffed with so many years of standing to scrub metal pots or pour a glass of tap water. The old woman inhaled quietly, and stared out the window at the lawn of her small yard to see the lemon tree that yielded lemons every other year, to memorize the potted ferns hanging from the shanty arbor built by a married man she had once loved. As she exhaled, the cigarette smoke resembled coiled earthworms without the earth, and she studied the shrubs of bursting red hibiscus bushes that bloomed lush and rich as only ancient deep-rooted hibiscus shrubs can do. Chavela squinted to keep the fumes away from her eyes and then rested the cigarette on the cigarette-burnt windowsill where she had rested hundreds of cigarettes or saved little discoveries such as safety pins or loose Blue Chip Stamps or buttons. The old woman returned to her task at hand and placed another cardboard box next to the child. Chavela's shaky fingernails ticked against the cardboard lid like the rooster clock on the wall. </p><p> I'm trying to tell you how it feels to have no solid tierra under you. Listen to me! Where could you run? The sound of walls cracking, the ceiling pushed up into a mushroom cloud. Do you need Dr�no to clean out those ears of yours? </p><p> But the child heard it, a long rip of paper. </p><p> It just wasn't right. Nothing was left, I tell you. Nada. I cried for so long that if my grief had been a volcano, it would have torn the earth in two. </p><p> The child gazed at her, imagining an egg cracking into two jagged halves. </p><p> My tears could wash away mounds of clay, a flood as dark as blindness pouring from my eyes. </p><p> The child imagined a river of molasses. </p><p> And under all the rubble, under all that swallowed earth, the ruins of the pyramid waited. </p><p> The child knew the end of the story and continued stacking the matchboxes. Pay attention, Chavela demanded. Because displacement will always come down to two things: earthquakes or earthmovers. The child stared at Chavela's cigarette smoke coiling as thick and visible as the black fumes of the bulldozer exhaust hovering over the new pavement of First Street. </p><p> Now go home! the old woman said abruptly, packing a set of newspaper-wrapped plates in the box. At least you have one. </p><p> Saturday morning barely stretched against the skies. The dull gray doused the glow of the yellow porch light. The child lay buried under a heavy fleece blanket imprinted with a lion roaring. Someone had given the orange blanket to Grandmother years before the child came to live with them, and though she tried to be a good girl humming under the weight of the animal heat, the rigidity and the goodness became impossible. She poked her head out, saw morning light, relieved. </p><p> She yawned almost as earnest as the lion, and then swallowed a few times to clear the ocean waves in her head. Her hearing sometimes reached and sometimes connected or sometimes didn't connect to the waves of sea. Fever-sweaty, she wrestled one leg then the other from beneath the tight hot compress of the blanket until she was free to jump on the lion's incisors. The springs of the mattress squeaked and the headboard bounced and the pillows spilled to the floor and then Grandfather's thundering threat, Renata will get you! followed from the next room and she froze. </p><p> For weeks he had engaged the child's attention with the story of Renata Valenzuela, a local schoolgirl who had vanished, abducted one afternoon. Grandfather once pointed to a derelict house claiming it belonged to Renata's parents to show the child what could happen if she was bad. The neglected grass burnt to coarse pricks under the carnage of dead leaves heaped everywhere. The windows were draped in straggly black curtains. Tongues of paint curled from the rotted wooden door and whispered to the child of horrific grief. </p><p> At night the child refused to succumb to the long harrowing blankness and fought sleep in order to keep at bay the menacing Renata. Finally, the morning light arrived entirely, inviting. Her feet itched to walk against the cold hardwood floor and she slid off the bed and began to tiptoe to the window. She kicked aside a pillow and stubbed a toe on the doll that Mrs. M. of the Child Services gave her last Christmas. At the window, the child puttied her hot cheek against the rain-cool glass. On the other side of First Street, Chavela's blue house looked as empty as a toothless mouth. </p><p> The rows of vacant houses were missing things. Without hinged doors, the doorframes invited games. Shattered windows had been used as targets. Chavela never would have allowed her yard to weed wild, never allowed cans of trash to be scattered by the street dogs or left to the crows who pecked at coffee grinds and cucumber peelings. The earthmovers, parked next to the row of empty houses, were covered in canvas tarps and roped with tight-fisted knots to protect the meters, ignitions and knobs on the dashboards from the weekend rainstorms. Already the child viewed the two Gamboa boys sawing a butcher knife through the thic...</p></p><h2>Circle of Nine: 24 Stunning and Creative Quilts, One Unique Quilt Setting</h2><p>Discover the amazing Circle of Nine quilting and its almost limitless potential.

And the results are always incredible -- people's lives change, their goals are achieved, their relationships are healed, simply by letting in the angels who are always there waiting to help, full of joy and positive energy. <br><br>Gary explains:<br>* How you don't need to see angels -- or even fully believe in them -- to tap into their power.<br>* How to tell the difference between the messages of departed souls and those of angels.<br><br>And he answers questions like:<br>* What are the seven types of angels, including archangels, whom you can call upon?<br>* Why do certain angels come to us and how can we invoke them?<br><br>And he provides concrete advice and techniques, including:<br>* Prayers to help you gain access to your angels.<br>* Seventeen questions that will invite angelic guidance.<br><br>Gary also recounts the incredible story of how he first discovered his own angelic messenger in the Notre Dame cathedral in Paris at a crucial turning point in his life. And he tells the heartbreaking and ultimately inspiring story of how he struggled with his psychic gifts as a child and reconnected with them as an adult.</p><p>How can you get what you want from life? "Keep it simple," explains Gary Quinn, spiritual consultant to the stars, including director and actor Roberto Benigni (<i>Life Is Beautiful</i>), singer-songwriter Seal, and Olympic gold-medalist Katarina Witt. <blockquote>All you have to do is ask with a clear heart and an open spirit for what you want. You know what the first result will be? A resounding cheer from the whole angelic realm: "Hooray! You've figured out the secret!" Imagine all these angels eagerly poised for flight, awaiting only the barest invitation from you to soar into your life.</blockquote> <p> This cheerful book on divine benevolence exudes childlike naivet�. For instance, Quinn likens "angelic help" to a ride in Disneyland because angels are so happy, "delightful, ingenious and exciting." He acknowledges that belief in angels is a leap of faith, yet his warmth, confidence, and complete belief in angels is contagious. Within a few chapters, readers may find themselves enchanted by this joyful interpretation of heaven on earth. Contrary to popular assumptions, Quinn asserts that angels are not departed human souls (who tend to be far more less objective than angels). They are simply celestial entities with only one raison d'�tre: to bring joy to humans. He also believes that there are seven forms of angels: the Angels of Vision, Wisdom, Purity, Strength, Love, Peace, and Victory. Much of the book is devoted to explaining each of them. (The Angel of Vision, we learn, often gives us the visions that help us clarify and obtain our desires.) The final chapters are devoted to prayers and meditations to call forth angels as well as a section in which Quinn answers common questions, such as "What are guardian angels?" and "Why do angels come to us?" <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p>"<b>May the Angels Be with You</b> is not only the absorbing and fascinating account of Gary Quinn's journey with angels but also an inspiring and informative spiritual journey to take for oneself."<br> -- Mel Harris, actress-producer<br><br>"This book is insightful and goes beyond fact or fiction.

His most recent book is <i>The Sixth Man</i>.</b></p> <p> </p><p>I'm no stranger to Gregg Hurwitz's work. I tore through Trust No One like a meth addict on a binge. The guy does his best work, I think, when he takes a murky past and slams it in the face of his protagonist decades later. You're Next is right in this wheelhouse. The Prologue is pure adrenaline, heart-wrenching and starts the novel off on a terrific trajectory. A little boy wakes up and over the course of a few pages he is abandoned by his father. The reader takes an emotional arrow right in the heart. Right away we want to know more about the kid and what became of him. Lots of questions unanswered. But you know with Hurwitz that while the questions eventually will be answered, they won't be in ways the reader can easily predict.</p> <p>The boy has grown into a man, but he can't escape his past. Mike is a good guy trying to make a living for his family. An environmentally conscious builder, he works hard and tries to stand by his word. Before he can draw a breath he's hit by a tsunami. Events tumble out, each one more inexplicable and seemingly disconnected than its predecessor. What Hurwitz also does extremely well is put one in the moment. Big scenes are tough to write, but the smaller ones are tougher still. It's like the tendons and ligaments connecting the large muscle masses together. You mess those up, nothing else works right. He's also a fine wordsmith. "A gloved fist the size of a dumbbell flew at her, shattering her eye socket and knocking her back into the front door, rocketing it inward so hard the handle stuck in the drywall. A moment of tranquility. Even the crickets were awed into silence...His plain, handsome face was oddly smooth, almost generic, as if his features were pressed through latex." Good, good stuff.</p> <p>What Mike now faces are demons from his past. Desperate, organized, efficiently ruthless men are coming for him. But now it's not just Mike. He has a family, wife Annabel and their daughter Kat, a precocious eight-year-old. He has an ally from old days, before he was Mike, husband, businessman, father. The survival instinct takes over and the battle is engaged. I read lots of thrillers and mysteries, and have gotten pretty good at separating the wheat from the chaff, figuring out the foreshadowing, what seemingly insignificant clues, what seemingly throw-off lines and what nuggets of seemingly useless information are actually critical to understanding the plot. But Hurwitz is a skilled hand and at the end of the day I say just let this baby ride till the last page. Then you can close the book, stammer something about that SOB getting you again, and you can wait with breathless anticipation for the man to reload his Glock and fire away on his next thriller.</p> <br><p><b>"SMART AND RELENTLESS...never, never lets up..." </b><br><b><i>&#x2015;Cleveland Plain Dealer</i></b></p><p>Mike Wingate had a rough childhood&#x2015;-he was abandoned at a playground at four years old and raised in foster care.

In this troubling expos� of what went wrong, Christopher Cooper and Robert Block of <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> show that the flaws go much deeper than out-of-touch federal bureaucrats or overwhelmed local politicians.<br>Drawing on exclusive interviews with federal, state, and local officials, Cooper and Block take readers inside the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Department of Homeland Security to reveal the inexcusable mismanagement during Hurricane Katrina--the bad decisions that were made, the facts that were ignored, the individuals who saw that the system was broken but were unable to fix it. America's top emergency response officials had long known that a calamitous hurricane was likely to hit New Orleans, but that seems to have had little effect on planning or execution. <br><i>Disaster</i> demonstrates that the incompetent response to Hurricane Katrina is a wake-up call to all Americans, wherever they live, about how distressingly vulnerable we remain. Washington is ill equipped to handle large-scale emergencies, be they floods or fires, natural events or terrorist attacks, and Cooper and Block make a strong case for overhauling of the nation's emergency response system. This is a book that no American can afford to ignore.</p><p>"Tightly crafted, very readable . . . the best in-depth contemporary analysis we are going to get . . . Given that future catastrophes are inevitable, this book is a call to arms to demand a far more competent federal emergency response than Washington has been willing to provide." <p>--Stephen Flynn, The Washington Post</p>Christopher Cooper is a White House correspondent for <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> and a former political reporter at <i>The Times-Picayune</i>.

This lively refutation of cynical assumptions about our species considers the nature of empathy and the causes of war, why we (incorrectly) explain all behavior in terms of self-interest, and how we can teach children to care.</p><p><b>Alfie Kohn</b> is the author of ten previous books, including <i>Punished by Rewards</i>, <i>The Schools Our Children Deserve</i>, and <i>Unconditional Parenting</i>. He lives with his family in the Boston area."There is a widespread belief that our darker side is more pervasive, more persistent, and somehow more real than our other facets," writes Kohn ( No Contest: The Case Against Competition ), before going on to argue vehemently that human life isn't the nasty, brutish thing it's been cracked up to be since the days of Thomas Hobbes. The author builds his pro-people case in a well-reasoned manner. Starting from the premise that the power of "nature" is nowadays given undue weight over that of "nurture," he contends that character can indeed be influenced for the better. Kohn explores the concepts of empathy and altruism, pointing out that humans are the only animals who can choose to look at the world from another being's perspective, and he also discusses the thornier issues of violence and aggression. The book concludes by detailing a morality of caring that precludes Western emphasis on competition and rugged individualism. This is a subtle, many-layered effort, making a succession of provocative, well-considered points. Kohn's style is academic and often dense, but persevering readers will be rewarded. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Rifts World Book 4: Africa</h2><p>Rifts� Africa outlines key places, people, customs, and societies located in the wilderness of Rifts Africa.

There can be fall in summer, winter in autumn; sudden snow can freeze the summer crop, a warm wind melt the icy river. We complain and call the weather unseasonable, but we are not surprised. We are delighted when summer floods into fall, when a fall-crisp day appears like a miracle in midwinter. But we are not surprised. We know that, in the flux of seasons, we see each one more than once.</p> <p> But spring seems different. There is, sometimes in January, a springlike day when buds swell and flies� eggs hatch; there is, sometimes late in May, a winter storm to decimate the flowers. Both disturb us, disturb our springtime dream of waking into ceaseless sun and easy growth, of soft buds that flame into lasting blossoms, of graceful ease, easeful grace. Dozens of springs that creep upon us unawares, then fade imperceptibly into summer, can never convince us the season will not arrive in just one trumpet day. Spring, we fiercely believe, comes once to us and stays.</p> <p> We believe as much of a woman�s seasons. Spring, we fancy, comes to us once, goes once, is gone forever. But women spiral through life�s seasons like the world does its own: There are days of growth in youth, in midlife, in age, just as there are losses and cold in each. There may be a concentration of spring energies in the maiden, but she can feel as well the forces of fullness and decline. Women in their prime are maids and crones at once. And every aged woman knows still the wild spring winds.</p> <p> And when it comes, spring does not simply blow upon the warming air like blossom kisses. Spring is as much a time of pain as of growth. Imagine the egg, the bulb, the bud. All begin contained�all potential, endless promise. There is a quiet dignity in such presence. There is no strain, no disturbance by passion or power. The being rests within itself.</p> <p> But when growth begins, things break. Shells and bud casings, those intact perfections, fall away. What is revealed is unprotected tenderness. It is no illusion, this fragility. A fierce storm can shred the new leaf, a cat consume the tiny bird, a hapless word pierce the young woman�s heart. </p> <p> To the beholder, there is only beauty: the frail green hue that rivals all of autumn�s glory, the soft maiden gaze with its vulnerable longing. Springtime empowers its witnesses. And the woman gazing back may feel, indeed, the riveting power of her growth and potential. Or she may feel only the pain of new skin against cold wind, of exposed flesh against cruel stares. </p> <p> There are times the hatchling yearns for the shell, the woman for her girlhood. There are times the new body seems alien and ill-formed, the new skills awkward and mistaken, the new knowledge not power but frailty. Growth may be exhilarating, but it is never easy. </p> <p> And it is costly. Just as the bulb devours itself in order to burst above the soil, just as the hatchling digests its egg�s world, the woman tears springtime out of herself. She has little time for generosity, for she is focused on herself, on her deepest movements, her pain, her hopefulness. She is all stunned inwardness. </p> <p> She is one, alone, unique. She is piercedwith wonder at her existence.</p> <p> And from this wonder, she creates her world. It is a new world, for the world has never before been inhabited by her singular being. Her creation is a dance of wonder and power, of energy and discovery. Her dance draws the world�s eye, for although she has never before lived, she lives now, and in living changes the very essence of the world.</p> <p> She is each of us. We hold her within, just as we hold all seasons. Bend towards her when she sings her rasping song of growth. Honor both her pain and all her promises. And remember, too, to dance with her, for she is the power of movement and change. She is the soul within the body, the spirit flashing forth from flesh. She is the power of green life. She is the first being in the world�and she is you.</p> <p> ���</p> <p> Hera Renews Her Youth</p> <p> Now is the time that I choose. Hermit</p> <p> winter is over, my widow season.</p> <p> I want lust now, endearments,</p> <p> longing and song. The trees on </p> <p> the hillside renew themselves</p> <p> as I do. Oh, my grand thick trunk</p> <p> that holds me stiff so my tassels</p> <p> and catkins can fly! Oh, I�m drunk</p> <p> with my greenness again! Every branch</p> <p> has budded before, has flown</p> <p> into leaf and then blanched</p> <p> into fall.

The houses were shipped by rail to city lots and farms all over the country. <p>Each "kit home" contained 30,000 pieces, including 750 pounds of nails and 27 gallons of paint and varnish. A 75-page instruction book showed home buyers, step by step, how to assemble those 30,000 pieces of house. </p><p>Today, these houses are a treasured piece of Americana and nationwide interest in Sears homes is <i>great.</i> The Washington Times recently reported (September 13, 2001) that a Sears home in Chevy Chase sold for $816,000. </p><p>My research indicates that only 2% (approximately) of the Sears homes in the country have been discovered. <i>More than 70,000 Sears homes remain undiscovered and unknown.</i> </p><p>Because of this, our communities&#x2019; best architectural treasures &#x2013; our grand collection of Sears homes &#x2013; are being damaged by remuddling and worse, demolished. </p><p>I hope that <i>"The Houses That Sears Built" </i>will educate and enlighten people about these hidden architectrual treasures that lie silently within our cities, just <b>waiting</b> to be discovered. </p><p>There is tremendous interest in this topic and I hope this book will spur that interest even further. In my part of the country (Southwestern Illinois) these wonderful old Sears homes are still being remuddled and demolished. <b>This must stop.</b> </p><p>It is my hope that <i>"The Houses That Sears Built" </i>will inspire folks to <b>find</b> their community&#x2019;s Sears homes and implement policies and programs to highlight and protect these treasured bits of architectural Americana. </p><p>When you have finished reading <i>"The Houses That Sears Built"</i> <b>you</b> will be your community&#x2019;s expert on Sears homes. You&#x2019;ll learn how to identify Sears homes from the inside, outside and from courthouse documents. You&#x2019;ll learn the interesting details of Sears homes&#x2019; construction. One chapter is devoted to the $1 million order of Sears homes that was shipped to Carlinville, Schoper and Wood River (Illinois). </p><p>Another chapter is devoted to "The Lost Sears Homes." These are Sears homes which appeared only once in obscure Sears Modern Homes catalogs and were not included in <i>"Houses by Mail: A Guide To Houses from Sears, Roebuck and Company," </i>by Katherine Cole Stevenson and H.

She's also conducted surveys of Sears homes for several communities. As a result, Ms. Thornton found that she received frequent requests from people all over the country, asking for more information about these old catalog homes. Because of this, she decided it was time to combine her copious field notes with the tall stack of rare historical information she'd unearthed, and write a book: The Houses That Sears Built. <p><b>From the author:</b> </p><p>This is a topic that is near and dear to my heart. I hope my love of these <b>awesome</b> old homes shines through the pages of this book. Above all, I hope "The Houses That Sears Built" will inspire you to go out into your community and <b>find</b> the Sears homes that are hidden there. I hope this book will fuel your love of old homes, specifically Sears homes. And I hope that this book helps preserve and protect this country's dazzling collection of Sears Roebuck catalog homes.</p></p><h2>Only Time Will Tell (The Clifton Chronicles)</h2><p>The &#34;Clifton Chronicles&#34; is Jeffrey Archer&#39;s most ambitious work in four decades as an international bestselling author. The epic tale of Harry Clifton&#39;s life begins in 1920, with the chilling words, &#39;I was told that my father was killed in the war&#39;. But it will be another twenty years before Harry discovers how his father really died, which will only lead him to question: who was his father? Is he the son of Arthur Clifton, a stevedore who worked in Bristol docks, or the first born son of a scion of West Country society, whose family owns a shipping line? &#34;Only Time Will Tell&#34; covers the years from 1920 to 1940, and includes a cast of memorable characters that &#34;The Times&#34; has compared to &#34;The Forsyte Saga&#34;.

In Jeffrey Archer&#39;s masterful hands, the reader is taken on a journey that they won&#39;t want to end, and when you turn the last page of this unforgettable yarn, you will be faced with a dilemma that neither you, nor Harry Clifton could have anticipated.</p><p><p>The first novel in the Clifton Chronicles, an ambitious new series that tells the story of a family across generations and oceans, from heartbreak to triumph, from #1<i> New York Times</i> bestselling author <b>Jeffrey Archer</b></p><p>The epic tale of Harry Clifton's life begins in 1920, with the words "I was told that my father was killed in the war."

From a monotheistic perspective, this notion is irremediably heretical since it suggests divinity might be material, mutable, and multiple. Since the excommunication of Baruch Spinoza, Western thought has therefore demonized what it calls pantheism, accusing it of incoherence, absurdity, and&#x2015;with striking regularity&#x2015;<i>monstrosity</i>.<br><br>In this book, Mary-Jane Rubenstein investigates this perennial repugnance through a conceptual genealogy of pantheisms. What makes pantheism &#x201c;monstrous&#x201d;&#x2015;at once repellent and seductive&#x2015;is that it scrambles the raced and gendered distinctions that Western philosophy and theology insist on drawing between activity and passivity, spirit and matter, animacy and inanimacy, and creator and created. By rejecting the fundamental difference between God and world, pantheism threatens all the other oppositions that stem from it: light versus darkness, male versus female, and humans versus every other organism. If the panic over pantheism has to do with a fear of crossed boundaries and demolished hierarchies, then the question becomes what a present-day pantheism might disrupt and what it might reconfigure. Cobbling together heterogeneous sources&#x2015;medieval heresies, their pre- and anti-Socratic forebears, general relativity, quantum mechanics, nonlinear biologies, multiverse and indigenous cosmologies, ecofeminism, animal and vegetal studies, and new and old materialisms&#x2015;Rubenstein assembles possible pluralist pantheisms. By mobilizing this monstrous mixture of unintentional God-worlds, <i>Pantheologies</i> gives an old heresy the chance to renew our thinking.</p><p>Mary-Jane Rubenstein is professor of religion; feminist, gender, and sexuality studies; and science in society at Wesleyan University. She is the author of <i>Strange Wonder: The Closure of Metaphysics and the Opening of Awe </i>(Columbia, 2009) and <i>Worlds Without End: The Many Lives of the Multiverse</i> (Columbia, 2014) and the coeditor of <i>Entangled Worlds: Religion, Science, and New Materialisms</i> (with Catherine Keller, 2017).<i>Pantheologies</i> is an elegant and lively tour of pantheism and of the racialized gender panics it has prompted in Euro-American thought. I leave the book with the sense that the goat-god Pan is still roaming around, disrupting the either/ors of Western metaphysics and presenting a cosmos both more amazing and more discomfiting. Rubenstein has written an excellent book. (Jane Bennett, author of <i>Vibrant Matter: A Political Ecology of Things</i>)<br><br>In <i>Pantheologies</i>, Mary-Jane Rubenstein answers the old problem of the One and the Many by offering a resolute triumph of the Many over the One. Give Rubenstein a One&#x2015;any one&#x2015;and she will make a Many out of it. I applaud this temperament, as William James called it, and the intuition that it generates and reflects. Multiplicity, thy name is woman. Rubenstein will save us every time from the totalitarian tendencies of certain regions of process philosophy, from the Teutonic idealisms of post-Hegelian theologies, even from the totalizing forms of monistic pantheisms. (Nancy Frankenberry, editor of <i>The Faith of Scientists: In Their Own Words</i>)<br><br>It is not out of charity or historicism that Mary-Jane Rubenstein channels this maligned, misunderstood, and mangled legacy. No, there is something in the <i>pan </i>of theism that our Anthropocene mess of a species (its atheists and its theologians included) needs. Now. Mesmerized by the brilliant weave of <i>Pantheologies</i>&#x2019; irresistible irony, gorgeous prose, and holographic erudition, readers will be hooked by a mystery too suspenseful in its plotline and too urgent in its intersections to set aside. (Catherine Keller, author of <i>Political Theology of the Earth: Our Planetary Emergency and the Struggle for a New Public</i>)<br><br>Rubenstein's examination of pantheism renders a comprehensive and pluralistic view of the cosmos that will interest readers curious about the intersection of religion and philosophy. (<i>Library Journal</i>)<br><br>Rubenstein&#x2019;s critical readings are cogent and deft. The book is both erudite and adventurous.

Prichard preserves the 1970s setting and 1950s origins of the story, bringing listeners a well-paced narration of murder and politics--a combination of elements that usually guarantees an exciting listen. This audio entertainment is as well formed and fragrant as one of Wolfe's hothouse orchids (the stout sleuth cultivates them by the hundreds in his town house greenhouse) as Goodwin walks us through an explosive murder investigation and political wheeling and dealing in a tough yet intelligent read.

I am a Cordon Bleu cook. I have a working knowledge of minor electrical and plumbing faults. I am able to take messages and answer the telephone.<br><br>I would wish to bring my cat with me. Yours faithfully, Arabella Lorimer<br><br>It was the last letter to be read by the elderly man sitting at his desk in his consulting-room, a large apartment on the ground floor of a Regency house, one of a terrace, in Wigmore Street, London. He read it for a second time, gave a rumble of laughter, and added it to the pile before him. There were twelve applicants in all and Arabella Lorimer was the only one to enclose references&#x2014;the only one to write legibly, too, neatly setting down all the relevant facts. It was a pity that she wasn't a man...<br><br>He began to read the letters again and was interrupted halfway through by the entry of his partner, Dr Titus Tavener came unhurriedly into the room, a very tall man with broad shoulders and a massive person. He was handsome with a high-bridged nose, a firm mouth and rather cold blue eyes. His hair, once fair, was pepper and salt, despite which he looked younger than his forty years.<br><br>Dr James Marshall, short and stout and almost bald, greeted him with pleasure. 'Just the man I want. The applications for the caretaker's post&#x2014;I have them here; I've spent the last hour reading them. I've decided which one I shall accept. Do read them, Titus, and give me your opinion. Not that it will make any difference to my choice.' He chortled as Dr Tavener sat himself down and picked up the little pile of letters. He read them through, one after the other, and then gathered them neatly together.<br><br>'There are one or two possibles: the ex-bus driver&#x2014;although he admits to asthma attacks&#x2014;then this Mrs Butler.' He glanced at the letter in his hand. 'But is she quite the type to open the door? Of course the joker in the pack is Miss Arabella Lorimer and her cat. Most unsuitable.'<br><br>'Why?'<br><br>'Obviously a maiden lady down on her luck. I don't think I believe her skills are quite what she claims them to be. I'd hesitate to leave a stopped-up drainpipe or a blown fuse to her ladylike hands.'<br><br>His partner laughed. 'Titus, I can only hope that one day before it's too late you will meet a woman who will turn you sides to middle and then tramp all over you.'<br><br>Dr Tavener smiled. 'Unlikely. Perhaps I have been rather hard on the lady. There is always the possibility that she is an Amazon with a tool-kit.'<br><br>'Well, you will soon know. I've decided that she might do.'<br><br>Dr Tavener got up and strolled to the window and stood looking out on to the quiet street. 'And why not? Mrs Lane will be glad to leave. Her arthritis isn't getting any better and she's probably longing to go and live with her daughter. She'll take her furniture with her. I suppose? Do we furnish the place?'<br><br>'It depends&#x2014;Miss Lorimer may have her own stuff.' Dr Marshall pushed back his chair. 'We've a busy day tomorrow; I'll see if your Amazon can come for an interview at five o'clock. Will you be back by then?'<br><br>'Unlikely&#x2014;the clinic is overbooked as it is. In any case, I'm dining out.' He turned to look at his partner. 'I dare say you've made a good choice, James.' He strolled to the door. 'I've some paperwork to deal with. Shall I send Miss Baird home? You're going yourself? I shall be here for another hour yet&#x2014;see you in the morning.'<br><br>He went to his own consulting-room, going through the elegant waiting-room with a smile and a nod for their shared receptionist Miss Baird, before going down the passage, past the stairs to the basement and his separate suite. This comprised a small waiting-room, a treatment-room where his nurse worked and his own room facing the garden at the back of the house. A small, narrow garden but well-tended and bright with early autumn flowers. He gave it a brief look before drawing the first of the patients' notes waiting for his attention towards him.<br><br>Dr Marshall read Miss Arabella Lorimer's letter once more and rang for Miss Baird. 'Send a note by special messenger, will you? To this address. Tell the lady to come here at five o'clock tomorrow afternoon. A pity she hasn't a telephone.' He got up and switched off his desk light. 'I'm going home, Miss Baird. Dr Tavener will be working for some time yet, but check that he's still here before you leave.' He nodded and smiled at her. 'Go as soon as you've got that message seen to.'<br><br>He went home himself then, to his wife and family, and much later Dr Tavener got into his Rolls-Royce and drove himself home to his charming house overlooking the canal in Little Venice.<br><br>Arabella read Dr Marshall's somewhat arbitrary note sitting in the kitchen. It was a small, damp room, overlooking a weary-looking patch of grass and some broken fencing, but she preferred it to the front room where her landlady sat of a Sunday afternoon. It housed the lady's prized possessions and Arabella hadn't been invited in there because of her cat Percy, who would ruin the furniture. She hadn't minded; she had been grateful that Billy Westlake, the village postman, had persuaded his aunt, Miss Pimm, to take her in for a few days while she found a job and somewhere to live.<br><br>It hadn't been easy leaving Colpin-cum-Witham, but it had been necessary. Her parents had died together in a car accident and only then had she discovered that her home wasn't to be hers any longer; it had been mortgaged to the hilt and she had to leave. There was almost no money. She sold all but the basic furniture that she might need and, since there was no hope of working in or near the village and distant aunts and uncles, while full of good advice, made no offer to help her, she took herself and Percy to London. She had no wish to live there but, as the postman had said, it was a vast city and somewhere there must be work. She had soon realised that the only work she was capable of was domestic. She had no skills other than Cordon Bleu cooking and, since she had never needed to work in any capacity, she had no experience&#x2014;something which employers demanded.<br><br>Now she read the brief letter again; she had applied almost in desperation, anxious to get away from Miss Pimm's scarcely veiled impatience to get rid of her and Percy. She had agreed to take them in for a few days but it was already a week and, as she had said to Arabella, she was glad of the money but she was one who kept herself to herself and didn't fancy strangers in her home.<br><br>Arabella sat quietly, not allowing herself to be too hopeful but all the same allowing herself to picture the basement room which went with the job. She would furnish it with her own bits and pieces and with any luck there would be some kind of a garden behind the house where Percy could take the air. She went up to her little bedroom with Percy at her heels and inspected her small stock of clothes. To be suitably dressed was important.<br><br>She arrived at Wigmore Street with two minutes to spare&#x2014;the clocks were striking the hour as Miss Baird ushered her into Dr Marshall's consulting-room. He was sitting behind his desk as she went in and put down his pen to peer at her over his glasses. Just for a moment he was silent, then he said, 'Miss Lorimer? Please sit down. I must confess I was expecting someone more&#x2014;more robust.'<br><br>Arabella seated herself without fuss&#x2014;a small, nicely plump girl with mousy hair pinned on top of her head, an ordinary face and a pair of large grey eyes, thickly fringed. Anyone less like a caretaker it would be hard to find, reflected Dr Marshall with an inward chuckle, and just wait until Titus saw her.<br><br>He said pleasantly. 'I read your letter with interest, Miss Lorimer. Will you tell me about your last job?'<br><br>'I haven't had one. I've always lived at home&#x2014;my mother was delicate and my father was away a good deal; he had his own business. I always did the housekeeping and dealt with minor repairs around the house.'<br><br>He nodded. 'Why do you want this job?'<br><br>She was sitting very quietly&#x2014;no fidgeting, he noticed thankfully.<br><br>'My parents were killed recently in a car accident and now my home is no longer mine. We lived at Colpin-cum-Witham in southern Wiltshire; there is no work there for someone with no qualifications.' She paused. 'I need somewhere to live and domestic work seems to be the answer. I have applied for several jobs but they won't allow me to have Percy.'<br><br>'Percy?'<br><br>'My cat.'<br><br>'Well, I see no objection to a cat as long as he stays in your room&#x2014;he can have the use of the garden, of course. But do you suppose that you are up to the work? You are expected to clean these rooms&#x2014;mine, the reception and waiting-room, the passage and the stairs, my partner's rooms&#x2014;and polish all the furniture and brass, and the front door, then answer the bell during our working hours, empty the bins, lock up and unlock in the mornings. Are you of a nervous disposition?' 'No, I don't think so.'<br><br>'Good. Oh, and if there is no one about you will answer the telephone, run errands and take messages.' He gave her a shrewd glance. 'A bit too much for you, eh?'<br><br>'Certainly not, Dr Marshall. I dare say I should call you sir? I would be glad to come and work for you.'<br><br>'Shall we give it a month's trial? Mrs Lane who is retiring should be in her room now. If you will go with Miss Baird she will introduce you. Come back here, if you please, so that we can make final arrangements.'<br><br>The basement wasn't quite what Arabella had imagined but it had possibilities. It was a large room; its front windows gave a view of passing feet and were heavily barred but the windows at the other end of the room, although small, could be opened. There was a door loaded down with bolts and locks and chains beside them, leading out to a small paved area with the garden beyond. At one side there was a door opening into a narrow passage with a staircase leading to the floor above and ending in another heavy door and, beside the staircase, a very small kitchen and an even smaller shower-room. Mrs Lane trotted ahead of her, pointing out the amenities. 'Of course I shall 'ave ter take me things with me, ducks&#x2014;going up ter me daughter, yer see; she's got a room for me.'<br><br>'I have some furniture, Mrs Lane,' said Arabella politely. 'I only hope to be able to make it as cosy as you have done.'<br><br>Mrs Lane preened. 'Well, I've me pride, love. A bit small and young, aint yer?'<br><br>'Well, I'm very strong and used to housework. When did you want to leave, Mrs Lane?'<br><br>'Just as soon as yer can get 'ere. Bin 'appy 'ere, I 'ave, but I'm getting on a bit&#x2014;the stairs is a bit much. 'Is nibs 'as always 'ad a girl come in ter answer the door, which save me feet,' She chuckled. ''E won't need 'er now!'<br><br>Back with Dr Marshall, Arabella, bidden to sit, sat.<br><br>'Well, want to come here and work?'<br><br>'Yes, I do and I will do my best to satisfy you, sir.'<br><br>'Good. Fix up dates and so on with Mrs Lane and let me know when you're going to come.' He added sharply. 'There must be no gap between Mrs Lane going and you coming, understand.'<br><br>Outside in the street she went looking for a telephone box to ring the warehouse in Sherborne and arrange for her furniture to be brought to London. It was a matter of urgency and for once good fortune was on her side. There was a load leaving for London in three days' time and her few things could be sent with it and at a much smaller cost than she had expected. She went back to Mrs Lane, going down the few steps to the narrow door by the barred window and explaining carefully. 'If I might come here some time during the morning and you leave in the afternoon, could we manage to change over without upsetting your routine here?'<br><br>'Don't see why not, ducks. Me son-in-law's coming with a van so I'll clear off as soon as yer 'ere.'<br><br>'Then I'll let Dr Marshall know.'<br><br>'Do that. I'll 'ave ter see 'im for me wages&#x2014;I'll tell 'im likewise.'<br><br>Back at Miss Pimm's, Arabella told her that she would be leaving in three days and ate her supper&#x2014;fish and chips from the shop on the corner&#x2014;and went to bed, explaining to Percy as she undressed that he would soon have a home of his own again. He was a docile cat but he hadn't been happy at Miss Pimm's; it was a far cry from the roomy house and garden that he had always lived in. Now he curled up on the end of her narrow bed and went to sleep, instinct telling him that better times were in store.<br><br>Dr Marshall sat at his desk for some time doing nothing after Arabella had gone. Presently he gave a rich chuckle and when Miss Baird came in he asked her. 'Well, what do you think of our new caretaker?'<br><br>Miss Baird gave him a thoughtful look. 'A very nice young lady, sir. I only hope she's up to all that hard housework.'<br><br>'She assures me that she is a most capable worker. She will start in three days' time and I must be sure and be here when Dr Tavener sees her for the first time.'</p><h2>10% Human: How Your Body&#39;s Microbes Hold the Key to Health and Happiness</h2><p><p>You are just 10% human. For every one of the cells that make up the vessel that you call your body, there are nine impostor cells hitching a ride. You are not just flesh and blood, muscle and bone, brain and skin, but also bacteria and fungi. Over your lifetime, you will carry the equivalent weight of five African elephants in microbes. You are not an individual but a colony.</p><p>Until recently, we had thought our microbes hardly mattered, but science is revealing a different story, one in which microbes run our bodies and becoming a healthy human is impossible without them. </p><p>In this riveting, shocking, and beautifully written book, biologist Alanna Collen draws on the latest scientific research to show how our personal colony of microbes influences our weight, our immune system, our mental health, and even our choice of partner. She argues that so many of our modern diseases&#x2014;obesity, autism, mental illness, digestive disorders, allergies, autoimmunity afflictions, and even cancer&#x2014;have their root in our failure to cherish our most fundamental and enduring relationship: that with our personal colony of microbes. </p><p>Many of the questions about modern diseases left unanswered by the <em>Human Genome Project</em> are illuminated by this new science. And the good news is that unlike our human cells, we can change our microbes for the better. Collen&#x2019;s book is a revelatory and indispensable guide. It is science writing at its most relevant: life&#x2014;and your body&#x2014;will never seem the same again.</p><p>There&#x2019;s more to being human than you think. </p><p>Have you ever wondered why so many people are overweight? Or why nearly half of youngsters have allergies? Has it ever seemed strange that depression is so common? Or that more and more children are being diagnosed with autism?</p><p>Using the latest scientific research, Alanna Collen reveals the link between ill health and the body&#x2019;s community of microbes. Many of the modern illnesses we accept as part of life are instead newly emerging conditions brought on by our failure to cherish the extension of our human cells: our microbes. </p><p>In <em>10% Human</em>, Collen explains how messing with your microbes can affect your metabolism, your mind, and your immune system; why antibiotics, C-sections, and infant formula can cause collateral damage; and how diet can restore a beneficial community of microbes. <em>10% Human</em> is an alarm call on behalf of our most faithful companions.</p></p><p><p>Alanna Collen is a science writer with a master's degree in biology from Imperial College London and a PhD in evolutionary biology from University College London and the Zoological Society of London.

M.</p><p></p><h2>A Very Easy Death</h2><p>When her mother was in the hospital with terminal cancer, Simone had time to reminisce about her mother&#39;s early life, as Simone and her sister, Poupette, prepared to face the decision of whether to prolong a life when it is full of suffering. Like most people, they believed that it would be better to die than to continue to suffer, but their mother had a very different view of the matter. Francoise de Beauvoir had finally found happiness in her life, and she truly believed she could find happiness in her own suffering. Considered by many to be the master work by Simone de Beauvoir, A Very Easy Death focuses on death and the other limitations in one&#39;s life and with what attitude one approaches them. Through her mother&#39;s beauty, her smile, and her pride in her life and in herself, Simone learned that to be human and to have individual choice are the most important aspects of existence.</p><p>A poignant account of her mother&#39;s death from cancer.<p><strong>Simon de Beauvoir </strong>(1908-1986) was a French writer and intellectual whose works played an important role in the feminist movement.

Her groundbreaking debut novel, From Doon With Death, was first published in 1964 and introduced the reader to her enduring and popular detective, Inspector Reginald Wexford, who went on to feature in twenty-four of her subsequent novels. With worldwide sales of approximately 20 million copies, Rendell was a regular Sunday Times bestseller. Her sixty bestselling novels include police procedurals, some of which have been successfully adapted for TV, stand-alone psychological mysteries, and a third strand of crime novels under the pseudonym Barbara Vine. Very much abreast of her times, the Wexford books in particular often engaged with social or political issues close to her heart. Rendell won numerous awards, including the Crime Writers&#39; Association Gold Dagger for 1976&#39;s best crime novel with A Demon in My View, a Gold Dagger award for Live Flesh in 1986, and the Sunday Times Literary Award in 1990. In 2013 she was awarded the Crime Writers&#39; Association Cartier Diamond Dagger for sustained excellence in crime writing. In 1996 she was awarded the CBE and in 1997 became a Life Peer. Ruth Rendell died in May 2015.

Weisberg reveals that the Naturalists went beyond Impressionism in both technique and subject matter. 307 illustrations, 86 in full color.</p><p>Eclipsed by the Impressionists, Naturalist painters are restored to their rightful place in the history of art in this remarkable, lavishly illustrated study. Influenced by Emile Zola's writings, French Naturalist artists documented personalities and locales in a detached, impersonal style. With photography as their chief tool and ally, the Naturalists aimed for the look of unposed, spontaneous nature, which put them on a collision course with the Impressionists. Naturalists were castigated as "photo-realists" as early as the 1890s. Some Naturalists produced socially aware canvases of coal miners or strikers; others depicted nudes, rustic scenes, life's trials. The movement became international, encompassing artists from Britain, Germany, Holland, Belgium, Scandinavia, Hungary and the U.S. The best of these pictures are uncompromisingly honest and strikingly beautiful, eschewing anecdote and sentiment. Weisberg is an art history professor at the University of Minnesota. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Walking the Bridgeless Canyon: Repairing the Breach Between the Church and the LGBT Community</h2><p>In 2001, Kathy Baldock, a straight conservative evangelical Christian, met Netto Montoya, a lesbian Native American, on the local hiking trails near her home in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Their friendship challenged Baldocks cultural and religious beliefs about gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender people.In Walking the Bridgeless Canyon: Repairing the Breach between the Church and the LGBT Community, Baldock uncovers the historical, cultural, medical, and political filters of discrimination through which the LGBT community is seen. With the foundation firmly established, she examines the most controversial filter of all: what the Bible says about same-sex behavior.Ten years of research, as well as relationships with thousands of gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender people, led to answering important questions:How did history, culture, science, and politics intertwine to create social discrimination against the gay and transgender community?When and why did the conservative Christian community turn their focus on the gay and transgender community?Should Christian fellowship be extended to gay and transgender people? Should civil marriages, or even Christian marriages, be granted to them?What is happening within the LGBT Christian movement today? Baldock carefully constructs a timeline as she untangles the details of various influences and influencers. Along the way, she shares fascinating stories and testimonies enriching the historical journey. Finally, for those who are wondering how they might enter into productive and respectful conversations about the intersection of faith and sexual orientation or gender identity, this book offers the resources and tools needed to make informed and wise, Christ-centered choices.</p><p><b>Kathy Baldock<b></b> is the founder and Executive Director of Canyonwalker Connections, whose mission is to help repair the breach between the Christian church and the LGBT community through education, encouragement, and engagement.<br> She is one of the most vocal advocates for inclusion within the conservative church and the founder of the str8apology movement, bringing LGBT people and straight Christians together at Gay Pride events to reflect the love of Jesus.<br> She is the mother of two straight adult children, and is honored to serve as a spiritual mother to hundreds of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender children.

Teachers will find it an invaluable instructional tool to help students confront, understand, and never forget the people lost, the lives forever torn apart, and the events that gave rise to the persecution. Yad Vashem, created by the Israeli Parliament in 1953 as the premier memorial for the Jewish people, contains the world&#39;s single largest repository of information on the Holocaust; its name is synonymous with the most extensive collection of published and unpublished documents on this subject in existence in one place. Written in association with Yad Vashem, this encyclopedia features eight essays on the Holocaust on such topics as the history of European Jewry, Jewish achievements and contributions to European culture, and the rise of anti-Semitism. The essays are followed by more than 650 entries on the major subjects of the Holocaust, including people, cities and countries, camps, resistance movements, political actions, and outcomes. More than 300 black-and-white photographs - many never before published in one resource - bear witness to the horrors of the Nazi regime and attest to the invincibility of the human spirit. This book covers people such as: Irena Adamowicz, David Ben-Gurion, Winston Churchill, Charles de Gaulle, Jacob Edelstein, Adolf Eichmann, Dwight David Eisenhower, Anne Frank, Joseph Goebbels, Herman Goring, Rudolf Hess, Heinrich Himmler, Adolf Hitler, Cordell Hull, Josef Mengele, Benito Mussolini, Pope Pius XII, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Oskar Schindler, Joseph Stalin, Raoul Wallenberg, Elie Wiesel, Simon Wiesenthal, and Kurt Waldheim. It covers nations such as Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Great Britain, Hungary, Italy, The Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Soviet Union, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United States, and Yugoslavia. It covers cities such as Antwerp, Berlin, Brussels, Luxembourg, Munich, Minsk, Nuremberg, Odessa, Paris, Prague, and Warsaw. It covers camps such as: Auschwitz, Belzec, Bergen-Belsen, Blechhammer, Buchenwald, Dachau, Gross-Rosen, Pawiak Prison, Plaszow, Ravensbruck, Sachsenhausen, Sobibor, Skarzysko-Kamienna, Strasshof, Stutthof, and Treblinka. Events: The Anschluss, Anti-Nazi Boycotts, the Barbie Trial, the Bermuda Conference, Death Marches, the Eichmann Trial, Slovak National Uprising, and the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. It also covers organizations such as: American Jewish Conference, Christian Churches, Council for German Jewry, Deutsche Ausrustungswerke, French Police, the Gestapo, Hungarian Gendarmerie, Institut d&#39;Etudes des Questions Juives, Iron Guard, Office of Special Investigations, Red Cross International, Relief Committee for the War-stricken Jewish Population, United Nations War Crimes Commission, War Refugee Board, the Wehrmacht, and World Jewish Congress and much more.</p><p>Combining essays (ranging in length from 4 to more than 15 pages) with encyclopedia entries, this reference work offers student and adult researchers a comprehensive look at the Holocaust. The eight essays, covering a variety of Holocaust-related topics, were all written by scholars associated with Yad Vashem, the Holocaust Martyrs' and Heroes' Remembrance Authority in Israel. Covering topics such as different aspects of European Jewry, the Nazi rise to power, the Allies, and the aftermath of the Holocaust, the essays are written in a very readable style. Unfortunately, the dense text and few photographs make them appear otherwise. Words in capital letters indicate entries in the encyclopedia portion of the volume.<p>The encyclopedia contains more than 650 alphabetical entries covering famous, infamous, and unfamiliar people; places, such as countries and concentration camps; events, including death marches and Kristallnacht; and concepts, such as <i>Art of the Holocaust</i> , <i>Aryanization</i> , and <i>Final Solution</i> . The entries vary in length from one paragraph to several pages and, like the essays, are readable for students. Captioned black-and-white photographs, totaling more than 300, appear on many of the pages. Most are of people, but some illustrate documents and places. Words and phrases within the text, printed in capital letters, indicate other entries in the encyclopedia.</p><p>The volume includes a day-by-day chronology from 1933 to 1945, a bibliography arranged by subject, and an index. The bibliography contains mainly adult titles, many of which will not be accessible for younger high-school students who could be using the volume. Bolface numbers in the index denote encyclopedia entries.</p><p>The contributing scholars have managed to make the information accessible to many age groups. This volume is written in a style that will make it useful for high-school students looking for information on various aspects of the Holocaust, and even the adult researcher will find in-depth nformation on most Holocaust topics. Larger libraries should have both this title and the more detailed and comprehensive <i>Encyclopedia of the Holocaust </i> published by Macmillan in 1990, but smaller libraries may find the title under review sufficient for their needs. <i>RBB</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

His painful formative days at Exeter, where he was sent like a naive lamb to a high WASP academic slaughter, are followed by a poetic self-liberation of sorts at Harvard. Here he rubs elbows with Frank O&#x2019;Hara, John Ashbery, and Edward Gorey, and begins lifelong friendships with Robert Bly, Adrienne Rich, and George Plimpton. After Harvard, Hall is off to Oxford, where the high spirits and rampant poetry careerism of the postwar university scene are brilliantly captured.<br> At eighty, Hall is as painstakingly honest about his failures and low points as a poet, writer, lover, and father as he is about his successes, making Unpacking the Boxes &#x2014; his first book since being named poet laureate &#x2014; both revelatory and tremendously poignant.<br></p><p><p>DONALD HALL (1928-2018) served as poet laureate of the United States from 2006 to 2007. He was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters and a recipient of the National Medal of the Arts, awarded by the president.</p>Domains<p></p><p></p>At fourteen I decided to spend my life writing poetry, which is what I have done. My parents supported my desire, or at least did not attempt to dissuade me. My father hated his work, and it was his passion that I should do what I wanted to do. My mother was prevented by her gender and her era (born 1903) from exercising her intense aimless ambition, which settled on me. They worried how I would make a living at poetry, but would not pressure me to join the prosperous family business, the Brock-Hall Dairy in Connecticut, where my father added columns of figures from Monday into Saturday. Their support was affectionate, _passive, and generous. Beginning when I was a freshman in high school, they gave me for Christmas and birthdays the many books of poetry I listed for them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why did I come to poetry at such an age? A few years ago in Nebraska, talking about my beginnings to high school students, I told about wanting to write because I loved Poe and Keats, later Eliot and Yeats. A skeptical boy asked, "Didn't you do it to pick up chicks?" "Yes!" I answered. "How could I forget?" In the absence of athletic skill, I found that poetry attracted at least the arty girls if not the cheerleaders. Ambition exists to provide avenue for the libido. This notion begets another, less flattering to the peacock male ego: Maybe all women are the one woman, and everything gets done to woo Mom.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My mother died at ninety, in 1994, while my wife Jane Kenyon was sick. I emptied my mother's house, and a moving van left seventy or eighty boxes at our house and at a cottage we owned down the road. For a long time I could not open them. Three years after Jane died my assistant Kendel Currier moved into the cottage and helped me unpack the boxes. Most of the books would go to the library at the University of New Hampshire. From other boxes my childhood rose like a smoke of moths: a 78 of Connee Boswell singing "The Kerry Dance"; all the letters I ever wrote my father and mother; photographs of my young parents on the boardwalk at Atlantic City; my father's colorless Kodachromes of Long Island Sound; snapshots of cats dead for fifty years; model airplanes and toy cars and a Boy Scout manual, a baseball, and a baseball glove with its oiled pocket chewed by mice. I felt the shock and exultation of exhumation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For weeks I unpacked the boxes, releasing the beginning decades of a life that was concluding its seventh: There were reams of manuscript, a thousand poems, novels I wrote at seventeen and nineteen; high school magazines with my poems and stories&#x2014;the antique tracks of poetry and ambition. I found a high school theme called "The Wild Heifers." I found a verse play called <i>The Folly of Existence.</i> The unpacked boxes laid out my childhood and adolescence as if they assembled a model train, Lionel Standard Gauge, complete with a miniature village set beside the tracks, a hill for the train to tunnel through, a semaphore, mirror glass for a pond. I recollected earliest childhood, seeing a solemn child, three years old. He looks lonely, discontent, bored. At the height of summer he stands, wearing shorts with socks sliding down ankles over indistinct shoes, holding an indistinct toy beside a gray clapboard house, in heat and dust, under a sun that will not relent. The image resembles a black-and-white photograph, but I don't believe it's a remembered snapshot. In family photographs Donnie is spiffed up with his hair combed and water-slicked, his arms stiff at his sides. Donnie was spiffed up and photographed many times: not merely an only child but an only grandchild. Perhaps I was discontent as the focus of the family lens, standing under a sun of singular attention and expectation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In childhood nothing happened. Born in 1928 as Mickey Mouse was&#x2014;Thomas Hardy died that year&#x2014;I breathed the air of the Great Depression. Men stood on street corners selling apples and pencils; tramps came to the back door&#x2014;but my father had a secure job. My mother and father had married on September 10, 1927, and rented the second floor of a house on Coram Street near Lake Whitney in a neighborhood of Hamden, Connecticut, that developers called Spring Glen. Although my mother had been told that she was unlikely to bear a child, I was born a year and ten days after the wedding. When I was one, my parents moved, renting a small house two miles away in another part of Hamden called Whitneyville, originally the site of housing that Eli Whitney made for workers at his gun factory. (A dam at the end of Lake Whitney supplied waterpower.) By the time my father was born, in 1903, near Whitney Avenue, Whitney's village was becoming a New Haven suburb, and soon a trolley line ran four miles to the city's green. The family business thrived a few blocks from our Winette Street house. The Brock-Hall Dairy's horses and wagons delivered milk seven days a week to the back doors of New Haven and its suburbs. Hamden was my father's place, far from my mother's rural New Hampshire. Sometimes my grandmother Kate visited from the farm, a day's journey by train. My grandfather Wesley came rarely; he needed to stay home and tend to the animals. The generations were close in age: My parents were twenty-five when I was born, and Kate was only twenty-five years older.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nothing happened. Some stories of childhood are tales that grown-ups repeated. I must have been three when I pulled the carrot, and my mother told everyone what Donnie did. She kept a vegetable garden at the bottom of the back yard, and every night before supper she took me with her to pull a fresh carrot for my supper. One evening I walked into the kitchen, a little early, holding my carrot of exemplary intelligence. Memory is stronger when it recalls transgression. I played with a neighbor boy while a repairman worked on the kitchen refrigerator, which had a white coil at its top. The repairman's dented Model T, cut down to a pickup, stood beside the kitchen door on two narrow strips of breaking-apart cement. My playmate and I lifted chunks of concrete onto the pickup's bed. My mother, peeking out the screen door, issued a reprimand, and my friend and I set to undo the crime. I stood in the truck bed lifting chunks down to my accomplice, who wore an Indian headdress. I stood above the boy looking down on his head surrounded by feathers, and carefully dropped a large lump of concrete onto his skull. Oh, the bliss of targeting a head circled by feathers! He howled and ran home; I was sent to my room. Nothing happened. I was small when I wandered a block or two up Augur Street, and sideways into one of the short blocks that paralleled Winette, with no notion of how to get home. Desolation. A tender deliveryman in a red truck returned me to my distraught mother. When I was four I saw my first nude female body. The three-year-old daughter of friends of my parents, who also lived on Winette, came dashing naked out of her house as I walked up the street. I remember my wicked joy as I watched a flustered grandmother run from the house and grab Molly back into privacy. License and rapture began with this vision. My father's parents lived nearby. After a blizzard, my grandfather Henry Hall, who loved horses, had his picture in the <i>New Haven Register </i>because he saddled up and delivered Brock-Hall milk to customers with babies. (He kept a saddle horse with the milk-truck workhorses in the dairy's long stable.) Yet, Henry and Augusta were frightening figures to me&#x2014;because they were frightening to my parents. Their house was always dark; it felt like held breath. When we visited them, often on Sundays, I picked up my parents' anxiety. Would my mother be mocked for her New Hampshire accent? Would my father be found wanting, and be chewed by his father's sarcasm? My father was first child of Henry the self-made man, known at the dairy as H.F., who left school after fifth grade and by hard, honest work built up a business. My father was raised to understand that he could never do anything right, and when he died at fifty-two still labored in vain for his father's approval. On the other hand, my mother grew up eldest of three girls&#x2014;she was forever the older sister; even in her eighties she was older sister to the universe&#x2014;on a farm in rural New Hampshire, oil lamps and church Sundays and an outhouse with five graduated holes. Brought together by the chance of college, in their backgrounds my parents were diverse. Hamden was alien in its gentility and sophistication, and my mother felt intimidated by the manners and mores of Whitneyville and Spring Glen. If she pronounced "Coca-Cola" as "Coker-Coaler," she was teased. Her mother-in-law Augusta had the habit, at our house, of trailing a white-gloved finger across the ledge invisible on top of a doorjamb, then displaying a digit of dust. Doubtless Augusta, daughter of unschooled German immigrants, had needed to establish her own credentials.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless, my mother tried to do everything as it should be done. She embraced Hamden's suburban culture with the appearance of enthusiasm. When she rode the trolley into New Haven, to shop at Malley's or Shartenberg's, she wore a hat, a veil, and gloves. My father earned thirty-five dollars a week, yet they spent five of the dollars to hire a full-time maid. Aggie (for Agnes) O'Brien, ten years younger than my parents, was not servile. She sat at the kitchen table with my mother, smoking cigarettes and chatting. I loved Aggie and cuddled with her, listening to her favorite radio programs. She agreed to wait, to marry me when I caught up with her. When my mother felt required to put Aggie in a black dress and black stockings with a white apron, like the French maid in the play, Aggie turned sullen. My mother costumed Aggie when she invited three women friends for bridge in the afternoon. I peeked as the women arrived, one with a fur piece, all lipsticked and powdered, smelling of perfume, three wives in their late twenties or early thirties, wearing dresses and girdles, wearing silk stockings and fancy shoes, wearing hats with veils: tea, cookies, and cakes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although my mother struggled to conform to Hamden, she returned as often as she could to the New Hampshire farm where she grew up, and to my maternal grandparents. Before I started school, she took me with her by train, and quickly I came to love the farm more than I loved Hamden's blocks of six-room houses. Preferring the one place to the other was choosing my mother over my father. A suburban child, I was all the more Connecticut in preferring rural New Hampshire. (Real New Hampshirites don't prefer the state; they are it.) My conflict of geographies&#x2014;two parents, two cultures&#x2014;shaped the devices and desires of my heart. It wasn't until I was fifty, and had moved to the empty maternal New Hampshire farmhouse for good, that I understood how assiduously my mother had determined my preference. Upstairs, Kate kept a fold-down desk of treasures, and there I found my mother's penny postcard, forty-eight years earlier addressed to Kate and Wesley from Connecticut. My mother wrote after she and I had returned to Hamden from a visit: "Donnie's been shouting 'Gale, Gale'" &#x2014; which was the name of the Boston and Maine depot a mile from the farm &#x2014; "and then saying 'Oh, there's Grampa.' He plays 'Go to New Hampshire on the choo-choo train.'"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kate Wells was a fierce conservative of family, farm, and church. Nothing in this house was thrown away; everything connected to the departed was preserved and cherished. Kate had been the beloved youngest child of Ben and Lucy Keneston, born when her father was fifty-two. She loved them back, and would never part with their detritus. The family's history is preserved in this house&#x2014;in mothholed sweaters, fragile quilts, broken chairs, mildewed books&#x2014;like Lenin in his tomb. Kate lamented that her eldest daughter had settled so far away, as I might complain if my son relocated with the grandchildren to Ulan Bator. My mother Lucy felt mildly treacherous because she had abandoned her family, even as she tried to adapt to Hamden: Automobiles, cigarettes, Scotch whiskey, bridge, and restaurants were none of them available or acceptable back home. As a propitiatory donation she gave my soul to New Hampshire, to house and landscape, family and culture. My grandparents accepted the gift, and my grandmother continued to cherish it into her nineties. I spent most of my young summers on the farm, in love with my grandparents and the disappearing countryside. I wrote my first prose book about these summers, <i>String Too Short to Be Saved.</i> I married; I provided Kate two great-grandchildren. When I lived and taught in Michigan, I returned every summer for a few days to the farm and the old woman who still kept sheep. In her nineties she asked me if, when I was far away and spoke of this place, I called it "home."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From Connecticut we visited New Hampshire off and on all year. Just before Christmas and in August, my father drove the family to the farm in the Studebaker. Otherwise, my mother and I took the train, climbing into the great steel cars that puffed steam at the New Haven station, sitting at a window on the right side of the aisle to look out on seagulls and oyster flats during our journey. The long links of our train aimed for the hive of enormous South Station in Boston, hub of the Hub. A man came through the car hawking magazines, cigarettes, chewing gum, candy, and cheese sandwiches. We were already provisioned. My mother opened the shoebox before New London, Connecticut&#x2014;exposing a chest (ingots and gold coins) of half sandwiches on decrusted soft bread, each in its own waxed-paper jacket: cream cheese and pineapple, egg salad, chopped ham and pickle; also a stuffed deviled egg; also a frosted cupcake. The New York, New Haven, and Hartford slid past the Connecticut shore, up along Rhode Island to Boston, where we alighted to take a taxi to North Station. The yellow cab beeped through Boston traffic. The station pointing north was smaller, less busy, not so shiny as South Station. From here we set out on our journey backward in time. The locomotive was old, the cars rickety, cloth seat covers ripped and sewed together. The train journeyed through suburbs for half an hour, then reached open country. I looked from my window seat at herds of Holsteins grazing in pastures among the shut-down mill towns (shoes, textiles) north of Boston. The conductor called out "Lowell," "Lawrence," "Nashua," "Manchester" at the brick stops between farmlands. The conductor was old, with a bright red face and a white handkerchief tucked between his neckskin and his loose collar. When he called out "Concord"&nbsp;&#x2014; "Con-CUD" &#x2014; we were coming close. "Boscawen" was pronounced "Bahs-COIN." (For years I assumed it an Indian word but it is Cornish, the name of an English admiral who fought in the French and Indian War. The resolution of that war opened this part of New Hampshire to settlement from Massachusetts.) "Frank-LIN." (Ben Franklin wasn't born there but Daniel Webster was, and it was to Franklin that my mother and her sisters journeyed by train to high school, as their mother had done before them.)

But when she takes it to her editor, she's fired on the spot and gets a death threat from the criminals she has uncovered.</p><p>Before the day is over, she's received a locket left by the mother she never knew-the mother who was murdered when she was an infant. Within is a knotwork pattern, which has a hypnotic effect on her. Before she knows it, she's transported herself to a parallel Earth, a world where knights on horseback chase their prey with automatic weapons, and where world-skipping assassins lurk just on the other side of reality - a world where her true family runs things.</p><p>The six families of the Clan rule the kingdom of Gruinmarkt from behind the scenes, a mixture of nobility and criminal conspirators whose power to walk between the worlds makes them rich in both. Braids of family loyalty and intermarriage provide a fragile guarantee of peace, but a recently-ended civil war has left the families shaken and suspicious.</p><p>Taken in by her mother's people, she becomes the star of the story of the century-as Cinderella without a fairy godmother. As her mother's heir, Miriam is hailed as the prodigal countess Helge Thorold-Hjorth, and feted and feasted. Caught up in schemes and plots centuries in the making, Miriam is surrounded by unlikely allies, forbidden loves, lethal contraband, and, most dangerous of all, her family. Her unexpected return will supercede the claims of other clan members to her mother's fortune and power, and whoever killed her mother will be happy to see her dead, too.</p><p>Behind all this lie deeper secrets still, which threaten everyone and everything she has ever known. Patterns of deception and interlocking lies, as intricate as the knotwork between the universes. But Miriam is no one's pawn, and is determined to conquer her new home on her own terms.</p><p>Blending the creativity and humor of Roger Zelazny, the adventure of H. Beam Piper and Philip Jose Farmer, and the rigor and scope of a science-fiction writer on the grandest scale, Charles Stross has set a new standard for fantasy epics.</p></p><p><p><b>Charles Stross</b> is the author of the bestselling Merchant Princes series, the Laundry series, and several stand-alone novels including <i>Glasshouse</i>, <i>Accelerando</i>, and <i>Saturn's Children</i>. Born in Leeds, England, in 1964, Stross studied in London and Bradford, earning degrees in pharmacy and computer science. Over the next decade and a half he worked as a pharmacist, a technical writer, a software engineer, and eventually as a prolific journalist covering the IT industry. His short fiction began attracting wide attention in the late 1990s; his first novel, <i>Singularity Sky</i>, appeared in 2003. He has subsequently won the Hugo Award twice. He lives with his wife in Edinburgh, Scotland, in a flat that is slightly older than the state of Texas.</p><p>Weatherman</p><p>Ten and a half hours before a mounted knight with a machine gun tried to kill her, tech journalist Miriam Beckstein lost her job. Before the day was out, her pink slip would set in train a chain of events that would topple governments, trigger civil wars, and kill thousands. It would be the biggest scoop in her career, in any journalist&#x2019;s career&#x2014; bigger than Watergate, bigger than 9/11&#x2014;and it would be Miriam&#x2019;s story. But as of seven o&#x2019;clock in the morning, the story lay in her future: All she knew was that it was a rainy Monday morning in October, she had a job to do and copy to write, and there was an editorial meeting scheduled for ten.</p><p>The sky was the color of a dead laptop display, silver-gray and full of rain. Miriam yawned and came awake to the Monday morning babble of the anchorman on her alarm radio.</p><p>&#x201c;&#x2014;Bombing continues in Afghanistan. Meanwhile, in business news, the markets are down forty-seven points on the word that Cisco is laying off another three thousand employees,&#x201c; announced the anchor. &#x201c;Ever since 9/11, coming on top of the collapse of the dot-com sector, their biggest customers are hunkering down. Tom, how does it look from where you&#x2019;re sitting&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Shut up,&#x201c; she mumbled and killed the volume. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to hear this.&#x201d; Most of the tech sector was taking a beating. Which in turn meant that The Industry Weatherman&#x2019;s readers&#x2014;venture capitalists and high-tech entrepreneurs, along with the wannabe day traders&#x2014;would be taking a beating. Her own beat, the biotech firms, were solid, but the collapsing internet sector was making waves. If something didn&#x2019;t happen to relieve the plummeting circulation figures soon, there would be trouble.</p><p>Trouble. Monday. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll give you trouble,&#x201c; she muttered, face forming a grin that might have frightened some of those readers, had they been able to see it. &#x201c;Trouble is my middle name.&#x201d; And trouble was good news, for a senior reporter on The Industry Weatherman.</p><p>She slid into her bathrobe, shivering at the cold fabric, then shuffled along stripped pine boards to the bathroom for morning ablutions and two minutes with the electric toothbrush. Standing before the bathroom mirror under the merciless glare of the spotlights, she shivered at what she saw in it: every minute of her thirty-two years, in unforgiving detail. &#x201c;Abolish Monday mornings and Friday afternoons,&#x201c; she muttered grimly as she tried to brush some life into her shoulder-length hair, which was stubbornly black and locked in a vicious rear-guard action against the ochre highlights she bombarded it with on a weekly basis. Giving up after a couple of minutes, she fled downstairs to the kitchen.</p><p>The kitchen was a bright shade of yellow, cozy and immune to the gloom of autumn mornings. Relieved, Miriam switched on the coffee percolator and made herself a bowl of granola&#x2014;what Ben had always called her rabbit-food breakfast.</p><p>Back upstairs, fortified by an unfeasibly large mug of coffee, she had to work out what to wear. She dived into her closet and found herself using her teeth to tear the plastic bag off one of the three suits she&#x2019;d had dry-cleaned on Friday&#x2014;only to discover it was her black formal interview affair, not at all the right thing for a rainy Monday pounding the streets&#x2014;or at least doing telephone interviews from a cubicle in the office. She started again and finally managed to put together an outfit. Black boots, trousers, jacket, turtle-neck, and trench coat: as black as her Monday morning mood. I look like a gangster, she thought and chuckled to herself. &#x201c;Gangsters!&#x201d; That was what she had to do today. One glance at her watch told her that she didn&#x2019;t have time for makeup. It wasn&#x2019;t as if she had to impress anyone at the office anyway: They knew damned well who she was.</p><p>She slid behind the wheel of her four-year-old Saturn, and thankfully it started first time. But traffic was backed up, one of her wiper blades needed replacing, the radio had taken to crackling erratically, and she couldn&#x2019;t stop yawning. Mondays, she thought. My favorite day! Not. At least she had a parking space waiting for her&#x2014;one of the handful reserved for senior journalists who had to go places and interview thrusting new economy executives. Or money-laundering gangsters, the nouveau riche of the pharmaceutical world.</p><p>Twenty minutes later she pulled into a crowded lot behind an anonymous office building in Cambridge, just off Somerville Avenue, with satellite dishes on the roof and fat cables snaking down into the basement. Headquarters of The Industry Weatherman, journal of the tech VC community and Miriam&#x2019;s employer for the past three years. She swiped her pass-card, hit the elevator up to the third floor, and stepped out into cubicle farm chaos. Desks with PCs and drifts of paper that overflowed onto the floor: A couple of harried Puerto Rican cleaners emptied garbage cans into a trolley laden with bags, to a background of phones ringing and anchors gabbling on CNN, Bloomberg, Fox. Black space-age Aeron chairs everywhere, all wire and plastic, electric chairs for a fully wired future.</p><p>&#x201c; &#x2019;Lo, Emily,&#x201c; she nodded, passing the departmental secretary.</p><p>&#x201c;Hi! With you in a sec.&#x201d; Emily lifted her finger from the &#x201c;mute&#x201d; button, went back to glassy-eyed attention. &#x201c;Yes, I&#x2019;ll send them up as soon as&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>Miriam&#x2019;s desk was clean: The stack of press releases was orderly, the computer monitor was polished, and there were no dead coffee cups lying around. By tech journalist standards, this made her a neat freak. She&#x2019;d always been that way about her work, even when she was a toddler. Liked all her crayons lined up in a row. Occasionally she wished she could manage the housework the same way, but for some reason the skill set didn&#x2019;t seem to be transferable. But this was work, and work was always under control. I wonder where Paulie&#x2019;s gotten to?</p><p>&#x201c;Hi, babe!&#x201d; As if on cue, Paulette poked her head around the side of the partition. Short, blonde, and bubbly, not even a rainy Monday morning could dent her enthusiasm. &#x201c;How&#x2019;s it going? You ready to teach these goodfellas a lesson?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c; &#x2018;Goodfellas?&#x2019; &#x201c; Miriam raised an eyebrow. Paulette took the cue, slid sideways into her cubicle, and dropped into the spare chair, forcing Miriam to shuffle sideways to make room. Paulie was obviously enjoying herself: It was one of the few benefits of being a research gofer. Miriam waited.</p><p>&#x201c;Goodfellas,&#x201c; Paulette said with relish. &#x201c;You want a coffee? This is gonna take a while.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Coffee.&#x201d; Miriam considered. &#x201c;That would be good.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, well.&#x201d; Paulette stood up. &#x201c;Read this, it&#x2019;ll save us both some time.&#x201d; She pointed out a two-inch-thick sheaf of printouts and photocopies to Miriam, then made a beeline for the departmental coffeepot.</p><p>Miriam sighed and rubbed her eyes as she read the first page. Paulie had done her job with terrifying efficiency yet again: Miriam had only worked with her on a couple of investigations before&#x2014;mostly Miriam&#x2019;s workload didn&#x2019;t require the data mining Paulette specialized in&#x2014;but every single time she&#x2019;d come away feeling a little dizzy.</p><p>Automobile emissions tests in California? Miriam squinted and turned the page. Failed autos, a chain of repair shops buying them for cash and shipping them south to Mexico and Brazil for stripping or resale. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s this got to do with&#x2014;&#x201d; she stopped. &#x201c;Aha!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nondairy creamer, one sweetener,&#x201c; said Paulie, planting a coffee mug at her left hand.</p><p>&#x201c;This is great stuff,&#x201c; Miriam muttered, flipping more pages. Company accounts. A chain of repair shops that&#x2014; &#x201c;I was hoping you&#x2019;d find something in the small shareholders. How much are these guys in for?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re buying about ten, eleven million in shares each year.&#x201d; Paulette shrugged, then blew across her coffee and pulled a face. &#x201c;Which is crazy, because their business only turns over about fifteen mill. What kind of business puts eighty percent of its gross into a pension fund? One that bought two hundred and seventy-four autos last year for fifty bucks a shot, shipped them south of the border, and made an average of forty thousand bucks for each one they sold. And the couple of listed owners I phoned didn&#x2019;t want to talk.&#x201d;</p><p>Miriam looked up suddenly. &#x201c;You phoned them?&#x201d; she demanded.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, I&#x2014;oh. Relax, I told them I was a dealership in Vegas and I was just doing a background check.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c; &#x2018;Background check.&#x2019; &#x201c; Miriam snorted. &#x201c;What if they&#x2019;ve got caller-ID?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You think they&#x2019;re going to follow it up?&#x201d; Paulette asked, looking worried.</p><p>&#x201c;Paulie, you&#x2019;ve got eleven million in cash being laundered through this car dealership and you think they&#x2019;re not going to sit up and listen if someone starts asking questions about where those beaters are coming from and how come they&#x2019;re fetching more than a new Lexus south of the border?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh. Oh shit.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes. &#x2018;Oh shit&#x2019; indeed. How&#x2019;d you get into the used car trail anyway?&#x201d;</p><p>Paulette shrugged and looked slightly embarrassed. &#x201c;You asked me to follow up the shareholders for Proteome Dynamics and Biphase Technologies. Pacific Auto Services looked kind of odd to me&#x2014;why would a car dealership have a pension fund sticking eight digits into cutting-edge proteome research? And there&#x2019;s another ten like them, too. Small mom-and-pop businesses doing a lot of export down south with seven- or eight-digit stakeholdings. I traced another&#x2014;flip to the next?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Okay. Dallas Used Semicon...</p></p><h2>Science Interactive Text Grade 3 (Student Edition)</h2><p>Brand new.

He wrote ninety novels and story collections, and among his immortal characters are Jeeves, Psmith, and the Empress of Blandings (who is, of course, a pig). Equally impressive is the range of his devotees: Dorothy Parker, John Updike, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Salman Rushdie, John le Carre, and Seamus Heaney. Wodehouse had an extraordinary Broadway career, working with Guy Bolton and Jerome Kern, and even dared to <em>re</em>write Cole Porter's <em>Anything Goes</em> for the London stage. Robert McCrum's magisterial biography chronicles the achievements and shadows of a gilded life. The ill-judged broadcasts from Berlin, where Wodehouse was interned during World War II, produced a violent backlash in England and tarred him, unfairly, as a Nazi sympathizer. His long love affair with America was compromised by endless acrimony with the IRS. This is the book all Wodehouse fans have been waiting for; it eclipses all previous accounts of his life. An <em>Economist</em> Best Book of 2004. 16 pages of black-and-white photographs</p><p>Robert McCrum is the associate editor of The Observer and lives in London with his wife, Sarah Lyall. His books include the bestselling The Story of English, My Year Off, Wodehouse: A Life, and Globish.In his authoritative biography of P.G. Wodehouse (1881&#x2013;1975), British author McCrum (<i>My Year Off</i>), literary editor of the <i>Observer,</i> rightly identifies the crisis over the great, if na�ve, English humorist's 1941 radio broadcasts from Germany (which led to accusations of his being a "Nazi stooge") as "the defining moment of Wodehouse's life." While the broadcasts and their aftermath get the most scrutiny, McCrum ably surveys a 75-year writing career that began in 1900 and ended only with Wodehouse's death at 93. He succinctly covers all the major topics&#x2014;Wodehouse's creation of the immortal Jeeves and Wooster; his triumphs as a lyricist for the musical theater; his frustrating stints as a scriptwriter in Hollywood; his tax troubles; his love of animals; his post-WWII U.S. exile; his long and successful, if apparently sexless, marriage. McCrum is franker on this latter subject than previous biographers and also dispels a myth or two. While Wodehouse largely left his financial affairs to his wife, Ethel, "in important literary business Wodehouse was always clinically decisive." When his new literary agent, Paul Reynolds Jr., wasn't successful, he fired him. Earlier studies have tended to be partisan or personal and stronger on some aspects of Wodehouse's varied life than others. For balance and readability, this popular biography, like Jeeves, stands alone. 16 pages of illus. not seen by <i>PW</i>. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In his unforgettable diary, Ransom reveals the true story of his day-to-day struggle in the worst of Confederate prison camps--where hundreds of prisoners died daily. Ransom&#39;s story of survival is, according to Publishers Weekly, &#34;a great adventure . . . observant, eloquent, and moving.&#34;</p><p>9 1-hour cassettes<p>"The Civil War produced many diaries, but few as appealing and readable as this one."&#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly<br></i>"An altogether exciting and unique, almost priceless documentary."&#x2014;<i>Library Journal<br></i>"A tale of adventure, of suspense from beginning to end, of fierce hate and great love, of the incredible callousness of man and the incredible warmth of man&#x2014;with the added knowledge that 'it really happened.'"&#x2014;Bruce Catton<br>John L. Ransom joined the Union Army in 1862, serving as brigade quartermaster of the Ninth Michigan Volunteer Cavalry. A year later, the 20-year-old soldier was captured in Tennessee and interned at the notorious Georgia prison camp, Andersonville. Ransom's harrowing firsthand account of Civil War prison life constitutes a valuable historical record&#x2014;a true story not only of cruelty, death, and deprivations but also of&nbsp;acts of courage and kindness that ensured the young soldier's survival and preserved his faith in humanity.<br><b>www.doverpublications.com</b></p></p><h2>The Testament of Cresseid &amp; Seven Fables: Translated by Seamus Heaney</h2><p><p>The greatest of the late medieval Scottish <i>makars</i>, Robert Henryson wrote in Lowland Scots, a distinctive northern version of English. He was profoundly influenced by Chaucer's vision of the frailty and pathos of human life. His greatest poem, and one of the rhetorical masterpieces of the literature of these islands, is the narrative <b>Testament of Cresseid</b>, set in the aftermath of the Trojan War, which completes the story of Chaucer's <b>Troilus and Criseyde</b>, offering a grim and tragic account of its faithless heroine's rejection by her lover Diomede, and her decline into prostitution and leprosy. A work of unreconciled Shakespearean intensity, the <b>Testament</b> has been translated by Seamus Heaney into a confident and yet faithful modern English idiom which honours the poem's unique blend of detachment and compassion.</p><p>A master of narrative, Henryson was also a comic master of the verse fable; his burlesques of human weakness in the guise of animal wisdom are traced with delicate comedy and irony. Seven of the <b>Fables</b> are here sparklingly translated; their burlesque freshness rendered to the last claw and feather. <b>Seven Fables and The Testament of Cresseid</b> is an extraordinarily rich and wide-ranging encounter between two poets across six centuries.</p></p><p>Praise for Seamus Heaney's translation of "The Testament of Cresseid &amp; Seven Fables": ""The Testament of Cresseid "is a beautiful, rare work, unique in the history of literature for [the 'recognition'] scene alone. Heaney has done us all a generous and graceful service." -Ruth Padel, "Financial Times ""The wintry force and appeal of ["The Testament"] are certainly apparent in [Heaney's] rendering . . . Read him and you'll want to experience the original, too." -Sean O'Brien, "The Sunday Times "(London) ""The Testament of Cresseid "is [Henryson's] masterpiece, possibly the greatest short narrative poem of the Middle Ages. It mingles human sympathy, moral judgment, ironic awareness and grim humour in equal measure . . . [Heaney's] translation of "The Testament "into modern English . . . is a reminder that translation is one of the glories of the English literary tradition."<b><i>The Testament of Cresseid &amp; Seven Fables</i>,<i> </i>translated by Seamus Heaney, is a</b><b>n exciting new translation of a classic poem by the renowned Irish poet and Nobel Laureate.</b></p><h2>Sense and Sensuality: Jesus Talks to Oscar Wilde on the Pursuit of Pleasure (Great Conversations)</h2><p><p><b>WHY <i>versus</i> WHY NOT? </b><br><b>&nbsp;</b><br><b>Why did God place us in a world full of pleasures if we aren&#x2019;t meant to pursue them all?</b><br><b>&nbsp;</b><br>In an imaginative dialogue, Oscar Wilde asks Jesus Christ to respond to this question about critical lifestyle choices. Their talk vividly illustrates the arguments for both sensual pleasure-seeking <i>and </i>moral moderation. <br>&nbsp;<br>Playwright, dramatist, poet, critic&#x2014;Wilde openly defied the mores of Victorian society.

After earning his&nbsp;masters' degree&nbsp;at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School, he began a speaking ministry that has taken him worldwide (including the campuses of Harvard, Princeton, and Oxford University) as a recognized authority on comparative religions, cults, and philosophy.&nbsp;His books include the Gold Medallion winner <i>Can Man Live without God,</i> <i>Light in the Shadow of Jihad, The Lotus and the Cross, </i>and <i>Jesus Among Other Gods.</i>&nbsp;He also teaches a weekly, international radio program&nbsp;<i>Let My People Think.</i> Ravi lives with his wife, Margaret, in Atlanta. They have three grown children.<b>Prologue</b><br><b>&nbsp;</b><br>It was a cold and windy day in Paris, just two days after the unforgettable attack on the World Trade Center in New York and the Pentagon near Washington. My mind was already sobered by those events. I had begun my journey to track the life and thinking of Oscar Wilde. I had rented a car and driven to the historic P�re Lachaise cemetery. The vast spread of land before me was quite daunting. I stopped at the gate and asked the guard to direct me to the grave of Oscar Wilde, and unhesitatingly he pointed the directions, as if he had been asked that question hundreds of times before. I drove to his grave, where I found a massive phoenix monument. On one side of it is a stanza from his powerful poem, <i>The Ballad of Reading Gaol:</i><br><i>&nbsp;</i><br>And alien tears will fill for him<br>Pity&#x2019;s long-broken urn,<br>For his mourners will be outcast men,<br>And outcasts always mourn.<br>&nbsp;<br>I sat there a while, reading the rest of the poem until two young people came by, one of them blind and walking with the assistance of her friend. They spoke a language I did not understand. Cemeteries are lonely places, but one of the best places to think of life&#x2019;s short span.<br>&nbsp;<br>The two young people asked if I could explain what was written on the other side of the tombstone. But alas, between their language and mine, I could not convey to them what the Scripture from the book of Job meant. That simple incident only reinforced the message of Oscar Wilde&#x2019;s life: It is very hard &nbsp;to be certain of what transpired within him as he came to the end of his days.<br>&nbsp;<br>Moving on from the cemetery, I spent an hour at the Church of Saint-Germain-des-Pr�s, pondering the memorial service held there for him. The church was filled with visitors<br>coming to pray following the terrorist attacks in the United States. Such horror drives people into churches. The images of grief and helplessness were written large on every face. It was no different in Wilde&#x2019;s life: In the end, it was the church that he turned to as sorrow gripped his own conscience.<br>&nbsp;<br>Tragedy seems a strange sentiment to feel when considering the life of one so recklessly committed to drinking the cup of pleasure to the last drop&#x2014;but ironically, it is the most appropriate feeling. Such a storm is created in one&#x2019;s heart by the clashing of emotions! How does one sift through the conflicting sentiments at the end of his life? I let my mind wander to that bedside in his hotel room where he lay a hundred years ago&#x2014;and<br>the conversation begins.<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Sense and Sensuality</b><br><b>&nbsp;</b><br>Oscar Wilde: <i>(Speaking to the nurse after another injection of morphine) </i>Another stab, another momentary respite from hell! You know, I thought living exacted all the pain there was to exact. I didn&#x2019;t know that dying possessed its own stock of torture. Would somebody write to my friend Robbie in London and tell him that I&#x2019;m dying beyond my means? Tell him to hurry and come.<br>&nbsp;<br>Robert Ross: I&#x2019;m here, Oscar. I&#x2019;m here. I was planning to come later this month, but &nbsp;when I heard how close to death you were, I took the boat over.<br>&nbsp;<br>Wilde: Thank heavens; I&#x2019;m so glad you&#x2019;re here. So it all ends in this dilapidated bohemian structure, l&#x2019;H�tel d&#x2019;Alsace, 13 Rue des Beaux-Arts. Maybe they should put number thirteen on my hearse. Quite fitting...the final address for a homeless man. Just<br>look at this place. It tells a story, doesn&#x2019;t it?<br>&nbsp;<br>Ross: So here in France they call this a suite, eh? But considering you have nothing to pay, I would stomach this if I were you. Although this thick red-velvet curtain around your bed is somewhat like a shroud. I could help tidy up, I suppose, by cleaning up these cheap French-cigarette ashes littering your floor.<br>&nbsp;<br>Wilde: Don&#x2019;t move any books or papers, Robbie. A room full of papers and books scattered all over is a tribute to a literary mind. And by the way, I like the red.<br>&nbsp;<br>Ross: I&#x2019;m glad you haven&#x2019;t completely lost your sarcastic tongue!<br>&nbsp;<br>Wilde: I&#x2019;ll tell you what...I&#x2019;m not sarcastic about that horrid wallpaper with its anemic-looking flowers. One of us has to go, Robbie, either the wallpaper or I.<br>&nbsp;<br>Ross: Right now it looks like the wallpaper is winning. It&#x2019;s so dark and damp in here. Nothing we can do about it, I guess.<br>&nbsp;<br>Wilde: Yes, the morgue yawns for me, Robbie. I&#x2019;d like to take a walk one more time. But I seem to move in and out of reality. I was thinking...I have tricked my way out of everything; I might work on a plan to trick my way out of death, too. What do you think? Maybe when that trumpet sounds the last judgment, I shall just pretend that I have not heard it. No, the laughter is dead, I&#x2019;m afraid. This nausea, this constant spitting of blood. It&#x2019;s awful, Robbie. My throat is a limekiln, my brain a furnace, and my nerves a coil of angry adders. Can you give me a glass of that absinthe there, please?<br>&nbsp;<br>Ross: You&#x2019;re not supposed to drink that, Oscar. The doctors have ordered you to stay away from it.<br>&nbsp;<br>Wilde: Since when have I taken orders from anybody? I simply can&#x2019;t believe they&#x2019;ve got this right, that this death-breeding spore has made its way into my spine. Ah! Remorse is but a beggar&#x2019;s refuge.<br>&nbsp;<br><i>Maybe when that trumpet</i><br><i>sounds the last judgment,</i><br><i>I shall just pretend that</i><br><i>I have not heard it.</i><br>&nbsp;<br>Ross: What do you mean by &#x201c;death-breeding spore&#x201d;?<br>&nbsp;<br>Wilde: One doctor has finally diagnosed what has brought on this meningitis, you know.<br>&nbsp;<br>Ross: What is it?<br>&nbsp;<br>Wilde: What I just said. This is an attack of tertiary syphilis, he says. This death knell hangs over me from that fateful night three decades ago.<br>&nbsp;<br>Ross: Are you sure?<br>&nbsp;<br>Wilde: That&#x2019;s what he tells me for now, but how can I be sure? Frankly, I don&#x2019;t think it has anything to do with syphilis. I think it has to do with this deadly pain in my middle ear. The ear surgery for that fall I took in prison has done nothing to help. But when you&#x2019;ve lived the way I have, they can get you to believe anything about the aches of your anatomy.<br>&nbsp;<br>Ross: No doubt.<br>&nbsp;<br>Wilde: Sometimes I feel like I&#x2019;m supping with the dead; at other times I feel the Christ I have battled all my life near at hand. Some things I see very clearly&#x2014;that zinc box readied for me that goes beneath the earth as if to cover up what one really is. At other times my head is overcome by a wave of ghostly personalities seeking to drag me in different directions.<br>&nbsp;<br>Ross: Should I talk to the nurse about giving you a larger dose of morphine?<br>&nbsp;<br>Wilde: No. The morphine doesn&#x2019;t work anymore.<br>&nbsp;<br>Ross: Then why not&#x2014;<br>&nbsp;<br>Wilde: Quiet! Please, Robbie! Silence! Don&#x2019;t disturb this vision. Here it comes again! Look at the size of this cemetery! The famed P�re Lachaise, ground for the great. Hundreds of thousands lie beneath. You know, Napoleon opened this cemetery. A<br>whole city of death! Some say about a million. What names, now food for worms&#x2014;Balzac, Abelard, La Fontaine. None speaking now except...<br>&nbsp;<br>Ross: You&#x2019;re slipping away, Oscar. You&#x2019;re not in a cemetery. You&#x2019;re&#x2014;<br>&nbsp;<br>Wilde: You know, Napoleon asked to be buried here, too. Maybe...maybe this spot is reserved for me. But I don&#x2019;t want it here. Bagneux is better, more genteel. You know, I often said that if a man needed a large tombstone in order to remain in the memory of his countrymen, then his living itself would&#x2019;ve been an act of absolute superfluity. I think I see the gardener... Tell me, sir, will it be a large tombstone?<br>&nbsp;<br>Ross: Don&#x2019;t go! Oscar!<br>&nbsp;<br>Wilde: Excuse me, Gardener! Don&#x2019;t walk so fast. Talk to me. Do you tend all these graves yourself? Are you real, or am I just talking to the wind here? Who are you? I&#x2019;m not going to miss these Parisian winters anymore, that&#x2019;s for certain. But please say something.<br>&nbsp;<br>Gardener: I wasn&#x2019;t able to get your attention most of your life, Oscar. Now all of a sudden you want me to talk to you?<br>&nbsp;<br>Wilde: Why do I think you are...?<br>&nbsp;<br>Gardener: Aren&#x2019;t you the very one who said that if I am perfect, I cannot relate to you? What do you want from me now?<br>&nbsp;<br>Wilde: I should&#x2019;ve known! I should&#x2019;ve known! You&#x2019;ve been mistaken for a gardener before, haven&#x2019;t you? Are you the Christ I&#x2019;m talking to? You know, I&#x2019;ve not done well with gardens and gardeners before.<br>&nbsp;<br>Gardener: I know you haven&#x2019;t.<br>&nbsp;<br>Wilde: You know it well, then. Life seems to start off that way: a garden before you...<br>&nbsp;<br>Gardener: It did once upon a time.<br>&nbsp;<br>Wilde: As I look back, my only mistake was that I confined myself so exclusively to the trees of what seemed to me the sunlit side of the garden and shunned the other side for its shadow and its gloom.<br>&nbsp;<br>Gardener: Your pain is intense now. What do you want from me? To help you escape once more?<br>&nbsp;<br>Wilde: Look what I&#x2019;m reduced to: failure, disgrace, poverty, sorrow, despair, suffering, tears even, broken words that come from lips of pain, remorse that makes one walk on thorns, a conscience that condemns, self-abasement that punishes, misery that puts ashes on one&#x2019;s head, and anguish that chooses sackcloth for its raiment and into its own drink puts gall. I often said that I wished I could look into the seeds of time to see what was coming.<br>&nbsp;<br>Gardener: You&#x2019;ve always had a way with words, dear Oscar! You&#x2019;ve come to the right place to see what comes to everyone. You did ask who I am, didn&#x2019;t you?<br>&nbsp;<br>Wilde: I did. I&#x2019;m somewhat fearful of the answer. Can I bring Robbie into this discussion? I&#x2019;m unsure of myself when facing you alone. Can&#x2014;<br>&nbsp;<br>Gardener: Not right now. Believe me; he&#x2019;ll have his turn. His mind, he thinks, is very clear and yours is confused. But not long after you have gone, he&#x2019;s going to come looking for me, too. But this is a time for you and me to&#x2014;<br>&nbsp;<br>Wilde: My heart is pounding like a hammer within me. This can&#x2019;t be true. I can&#x2019;t get it to stop its blows. I was fearful of meeting up with you, after all. All my life you&#x2019;ve haunted me. I&#x2019;ve sought to flee from you. You are...you are... Tell me. You are&#x2014;<br>&nbsp;<br>Gardener: Do you really want to know?<br>&nbsp;<br><i>How could You be the perfect</i><br><i>soul and still feel what we</i><br><i>humans do at the same time?</i><br><i>That has to be the greatest</i><br><i>puzzle.</i><br><b>&nbsp;</b><br>Wilde: Yes, I&#x2019;ve played word games all my life. But time has squeezed me out of playing time. I was afraid of all these things and had determined to know nothing of them, yet I was forced to taste each of them in turn, to feed on them, to have for a season no other food at all. No, I have not escaped. But here I go again. It&#x2019;s true. I&#x2019;m afraid it&#x2019;s true. I&#x2019;ve done well, talking all my life. I need to listen, don&#x2019;t I? I can&#x2019;t afford the luxury of toying with you. The Christ! You are, aren&#x2019;t you?<br>&nbsp;<br>Jesus: I am, I am. I wanted to meet you now while there&#x2019;s still time for you. Just a few hours, to be sure. This day was written in the heart of My Father long before it came to be. This isn&#x2019;t the best way to meet. Somehow over your lifetime you were delighted to live with a warring conscience. In fact, you still struggle.<br>&nbsp;<br>Wilde: I was a master of duplicity and was always thinking I could win at the game.<br>&nbsp;<br>Jesus: Trifling with truth? A costly game. Do you remember what your friend said of you: &#x201c;walking backwards toward the altar with your eye ever on the exit&#x201d;? And on another occasion, the letter written to you after you went to church on one occasion, cautioning you not to toy with things sacred? Do you ever think of those things?<br>&nbsp;<br>Wilde: How well I remember those words and that letter!Where do I begin? I just never thought You divine, Lord Christ. How could You be the perfect soul and still feel what we humans do at the same time? That has to be the greatest puzzle to me.<br>&nbsp;<br>Jesus: You have often called Me by My title. Let Me speak to you now, Oscar, you who once brimmed with confidence but are now only a shadow of yourself. What your imagination feared and your arguments resisted meet in this cemetery&#x2014;only reversed. Now your arguments make you fearful and your imagination resists this common event happening every day for somebody in this world.<br>&nbsp;<br>Wilde: I&#x2019;ve longed to know what Your voice sounded like. The Scriptures speak of Your voice as the sound of rushing waters. Quite a metaphor! But here You are, strong and gentle at once. Please keep speaking. The words seem more like arrows of truth<br>piercing the armor of my pretense. My mask is falling to pieces before me.<br>&nbsp;<br>Jesus: This is where I begin to question you, since you&#x2019;ve been so unabashed about your questioning of God. Do you who argued all your life about the breadth of the imagination limit God&#x2019;s ability to combine His mind and the need of humanity in one person&#x2014;Myself? Where was your own imagination when you thought that was impossible? And by the way, as for this &#x201c;perfect soul&#x201d; puzzle of yours...is it because you despise any form of reproof?</p><h2>Assail (Malazan Empire)</h2><p><b>The sixth epic fantasy novel from the co-creator -- with Steven Erikson -- of this brilliantly imagined world and the final chapter in the epic, awesome story of the Malazan Empire!</b> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tens of thousands of years of ice is melting, and the land of Assail, long a byword for menace and inaccessibility, is at last yielding its secrets. Tales of gold discovered in the region's north circulate in every waterfront dive and sailor's tavern and now adventurers and fortune-seekers have set sail in search of riches. And all they have to guide them are legends and garbled tales of the dangers that lie in wait -- hostile coasts, fields of ice, impassable barriers and strange, terrifying creatures. But all accounts concur that the people of the north meet all trespassers with the sword -- and should you make it, beyond are rumoured to lurk Elder monsters out of history's very beginnings.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Into this turmoil ventures the mercenary company, the Crimson Guard. Not drawn by contract, but by the promise of answers: answers that Shimmer, second in command, feels should not be sought. Also heading north, as part of an uneasy alliance of Malazan fortune-hunters and Letherii soldiery, comes the bard Fisher kel Tath. With him is a Tiste Andii who was found washed ashore and cannot remember his past and yet commands far more power than he really should. It is also rumoured that a warrior, bearer of a sword that slays gods and who once fought for the Malazans, is also journeying that way. But far to the south, a woman patiently guards the shore. She awaits both allies and enemies. She is Silverfox, newly incarnate Summoner of the undying army of the T'lan Imass, and she will do anything to stop the renewal of an ages-old crusade that could lay waste to the entire continent and beyond. Casting light on mysteries spanning the Malazan empire, and offering a glimpse of the storied and epic history that shaped it, <i>Assail </i>brings the epic story of the Empire of Malaz to a thrilling close.</p><p>IAN CAMERON ESSLEMONT was born in 1962 in Winnipeg, Canada.

Willful, independent, and full of mischief, she foils every attempt the king makes to betroth her to an acceptable nobleman. But at age 12, Sofia falls head over heels in love when she looks across a sea of people at a fair and into the eyes of a handsome knight, Sir Tobin de Clare. Over the next several years, Sofia and Tobin are thrown together on occasion; given Sofia's stubborn nature and Tobin's arrogance, it's not surprising that their acquaintance is stormy. </p><p> But no one could have predicted the fireworks that erupt when King Edward betroths Sofia to Tobin without her knowledge or consent. While there is no denying the passion that blazes between them, Sofia wonders if she'll ever really know the hard-edged knight. At the same time, Tobin struggles to come to terms with the depth of his feelings for his impossible wife. Each has emotional scars from their childhood and Sofia needs to know that she is loved by Tobin for herself alone and not for just her rich dower. And when fate intervenes with war, hostages, and duty to his king, the arrogant Tobin may make one wrong decision too many and lose Sofia forever.</p><p> Set against the backdrop of medieval England with all its pageantry, pomp, danger, and strife, <i>Wicked</i> is the story of two passionate, prideful people as they struggle to find a way to live and love together.

Daywalker Brynne Kirkland survived a hellish upbringing as a product of a madman&#39;s lab. Tough, driven, and devoted to her work in law enforcement, Brynne has never dared to risk opening her heart to anyone-least of all a handsome immortal from a world on the verge of war against hers. Atlantean warrior Zael left the intrigue of his realm several lifetimes ago, along with the battles he fought as one of the queen&#39;s legion. As a free-spirited loner walking the fringe of two worlds-that of his secretive and powerful people, and the outside world belonging to mankind and the Breed-it was never his intention to return to combat and bloodshed. Nor had he imagined that he might ever be tempted into anything stronger than desire . . . until he meets Brynne. Thrust together as allies of the Order in the fight against a diabolical enemy, Zael and Brynne embark on a mission that will ultimately force them to decide between duty to their people, and a passion that defies all bounds.</p><p>Lara Adrian is the New York Times bestselling author of more than twenty-five novels, including the #1 internationally bestselling Midnight Breed vampire romance series, with nearly 4 million books in print and digital editions worldwide.&#34;The audiobook was very entertaining and the narrator made Brynne feel both strong and capable, yet vulnerable.&#34; ---Oh My Shelves</p><h2>Bicentennial: Poems</h2><p>From the acclaimed poet&#x2014;a refreshing, singular collection of poems about boys and boyhood, historical cycles and personal history, memory and meaning.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Bicentennial </i>summons the world of Chiasson&#x2019;s seventies childhood in Vermont: early VCRs, snow, erections, pizza, snowmobiles, high-school cliques, and the Bicentennial celebration,&nbsp; but his book is also an elegy for his father, whom he never knew and who died in 2009.

The result was that the northern Black Sea Scythians developed first on the territory of Byzantium, and trade and industrial-colonization stretched from the Golden Horn to the Sea of Azov and the lower Don region. In addition, the Sarmatians and Getae on the lower Don were also involved in a profitable trade with this area. The continuing economic and political ties with the Don region and the Getae, with trade contacts reaching the Middle Don and the Southwestern Urals, even linked Byzantium with Russia prior to Constantine. From 580 to 300 BCE, Ionian colonization of the Bosporus gave rise to a number of systems that created powerful regimes to protect their strategic assets. Spartan colonists against the Scythian state from the Dniper to the Dardanelles also created a violent combination that almost constantly placed the region in chaos. At the same time, the region helped transmit Greek culture to Central Asia and southern Russia. During the last three centuries BCE, the region focused on trade with the new masters of the steppes, the Sarmatians living in Asiatic Scythia on its border with the European Don area. The trade network near the Don region in the beginning of the 3rd century BCE was marked by the city of Tanais. It was not until the 1st century BCE that the region was firmly part of the Roman Empire, and the Romans&#x2019; influence also ultimately led to the spread of Judaism and Christianity. Thrace: The History of the Ancient World&#x2019;s Link Between East and West analyzes the turbulent history of the region in antiquity. Along with pictures of important people, places, and events, you will learn about Ancient Thrace like never before, in no time at all.</p><p></p><h2>What on Earth Happened?: The Complete Story of the Planet, Life, and People from the Big Bang to the Present Day</h2><p><p><b>A gorgeously illustrated and wholly comprehensive timeline of the earth's entire history that explains how everything is interconnected. </b></p><p>As comprehensive as the subtitle suggests, <i>What on Earth Happened </i>is a primer for Planet Earth, a giant narrative leap across time and space, one seismic change at a time.

Now he brings together a lifetime of experience and teaching to redefine virtue&#x2014;how we learn it and live it&#x2014;for our troubled times. <br><br>John Bradshaw has written this book for the millions of decent, caring people who are struggling every day with painful choices, who are appalled&#x2014;as he is&#x2014;by the greed and shamelessness that plague our society, and who long for guidance for themselves and their children in an increasingly complex world. <br><br>Is the only solution a return to an oppressive, rules-based morality or an idealized past? Bradshaw says no. Instead he shows that each of us has what he calls an inborn <i>moral intelligence,</i> an inner guidance system that can lead us&#x2014;if we know how to cultivate it in ourselves and others.<br><br>His fascinating discussion ranges from the ancient Greek philosophers to modern explorations of emotional development, from provocative historical insights to the recent discoveries of neuroscience. Why do so many attempts at moral education fail? What is willpower, and how can we develop it? How can we navigate the inevitable problems of love and work and aging? How can we begin again after addiction or failure? How can we lead and discipline our children?<br><br>What emerges is a clear vision of a morality grounded in childhood, educated by the practice of both traditional and modern virtues, and culminating in the moment-to-moment ability to &#x201c;do the right thing at the right time for the right reason.&#x201d; <b>Reclaiming Virtue</b><i> </i>is both an inspiring appeal to what Abraham Lincoln called &#x201c;the better angels of our nature&#x201d; and a wise guide to building a life of unshakable integrity and well-being.</p><p>John Bradshaw was educated for the Roman Catholic priesthood and took advanced degrees in psychology, philosophy, and theology before becoming a professional counselor.

I have other concerns, some of which are more personal.&nbsp;<br><br><b>My Struggles with Rightdoing and&nbsp;Wrongdoing&nbsp;<br><br></b><br>For the first thirteen years of my life, I was a model child. I&nbsp;was a straight-A student, the president of my class every year in&nbsp;elementary school. I was my mother&#x2019;s favorite, always willing to&nbsp;help around the house, and the boy who cut the neighbors&#x2019; lawns&nbsp;and helped them with their groceries. I was the nuns&#x2019; favorite too,&nbsp;president of the Sodality of Our Lady, the society in Catholic&nbsp;schools that honors the Blessed Virgin Mary. I was considered a&nbsp;perfect little Catholic boy and the pride of my family.&nbsp;<br><br>But during early puberty all this good-boy behavior developed&nbsp;a dark side. My mother could no longer tolerate my father&#x2019;s&nbsp;drinking and womanizing and divorced him. I was shattered, and&nbsp;gravitated to other guys whose fathers were alcoholic and whose&nbsp;parents were divorced. We began to drink and frequent brothels.&nbsp;It was a Jekyll and Hyde existence: I was president of the senior&nbsp;class and second academically during my first two years of college,&nbsp;but I ran with a crowd that drank almost every day. I helped&nbsp;my mother financially but stole money from the place where I&nbsp;worked. By the age of twenty, I was a full-blown alcoholic and&nbsp;had a sordid history of sexual experience with prostitutes.&nbsp;As the pain of drinking and out-of-control sexuality intensified,&nbsp;I hit what is called in addiction programs an &#x201c;early bottom.&#x201d;&nbsp;I decided to follow the advice of the elementary school&nbsp;nuns and several priests, who had suggested that I had a &#x201c;calling&#x201d;&nbsp;to serve God. I entered the seminary at age twenty-one and became&nbsp;an exemplary but rigid novice, praying on my knees for&nbsp;three or four hours at a time, and fasting to a point where my&nbsp;physical health was threatened. After four years of this moral and&nbsp;spiritual rigidity, I began to loosen up. I secretly started drinking&nbsp;and stealing drugs from the seminary pharmacy. Over the next&nbsp;five years, this behavior escalated, becoming so bad that I was&nbsp;sent to two psychiatrists, both of whom advised me to give up the&nbsp;pursuit of the priesthood. I had struggled with the demands of living&nbsp;a life of poverty, celibacy, and obedience for nine and a half years,&nbsp;but I was afraid to leave. It was only during my graduate work, after&nbsp;studying the Greek philosopher Aristotle&#x2019;s <i>Nicomachean Ethics,&nbsp;</i>that I was inspired to take the risk of leaving my religious order.&nbsp;What I learned from Aristotle&#x2019;s work is one of the anchors of this&nbsp;book.&nbsp;<br><br>When I left the seminary I was thirty years old and truly a&nbsp;&#x201c;lost soul.&#x201d; I had advanced degrees in theology, philosophy, and&nbsp;psychology, but such degrees were hard to market. I finally got a&nbsp;job teaching at a Catholic high school but was soon fired for&nbsp;missing work because of my drinking. I was fired from my next&nbsp;two jobs as well. These firings helped me to hit my real bottom,&nbsp;and after an especially bad binge in 1965, I committed myself&nbsp;voluntarily to Austin State Hospital. My commitment required&nbsp;that I be there for only a week, but I was put in Ward 8, which&nbsp;housed people with a variety of psychiatric disorders, including&nbsp;those with severe mental illness. Six of us slept in a room that was&nbsp;about nineteen by twenty-four feet. Alcoholics were despised by&nbsp;this population&#x2013;we were not considered to be sick enough. I had&nbsp;to be constantly alert to guard against being killed. I left when my&nbsp;seven days were up and entered a twelve-step alcohol recovery&nbsp;program, marrying two years after I sobered up. I pursued sobriety&nbsp;with my usual zealous and polarized passion. I was exemplary,&nbsp;but I could never find moderation. I was either all good or&nbsp;all bad. I worked the alcohol recovery program rigidly for the&nbsp;first nine years and then began having affairs. The first six years&nbsp;of my marriage were wonderful, but I was a covert incest survivor&nbsp;and had a whore/Madonna mentality (which meant you&nbsp;don&#x2019;t have sex with someone you love), and after the first four&nbsp;years of marriage, I became sexually anorexic. I loved my wife,&nbsp;but when it came to genital sex, my body froze. None of this is an&nbsp;excuse for my sexual compulsivity&#x2013;but coupled with my nine&nbsp;and a half years of abstinence in the seminary was an elaborate&nbsp;denial system that allowed me to justify my sexual behavior. My&nbsp;sexual acting out intensified over a period of six years, and I&nbsp;slowly realized that I had become addicted in a new way.&nbsp;<br><br><b>A Profound Loneliness&nbsp;<br></b><br><br>Despite my sexual acting out, I had achieved a modicum of&nbsp;external success. I was making a six-figure income, had a counseling&nbsp;practice with a yearlong waiting list, and was a much&nbsp;sought-after speaker and workshop leader. I did part-time leadership&nbsp;training and stress management for an oil and chemical company,&nbsp;and did one-day workshops for several Fortune 500&nbsp;companies. Life should have been good&#x2013;but addiction is a profoundly&nbsp;lonely activity. I was living a lie. My brain engaged in&nbsp;doublethink, one part ravaged with shame and another part&nbsp;basking in the good work of healing I was providing for people. I could heal others but not myself.&nbsp;<br><br>I found the beginning of sexual sobriety on August 13, 1981.&nbsp;<br><br>I found it in a way that still baffles and humbles me today, which&nbsp;I will describe in chapter 5.&nbsp;<br><br>However, even in my recovery I remained cut off and felt disconnected&nbsp;from everyone and everything. There was an emptiness&nbsp;in me&#x2013;a black hole&#x2013;that held dominion over my life.&nbsp;<br><br>While I was living according to all the moral laws I knew, I still&nbsp;felt like I was on the outside of life looking in.&nbsp;<br><br>I felt no real connection to the schools I had gone to. Even&nbsp;though I had been senior class president in high school, I had little&nbsp;interest in my class and let others organize our reunions.&nbsp;<br><br>People I had been friends with in the past slipped out of my life.&nbsp;Sometimes I could hardly remember their names. I lectured at&nbsp;Palmer Episcopal Church in adult theology for twenty years, but&nbsp;after I left Palmer to pursue the challenges created by my PBS television&nbsp;series <i>Bradshaw on the Family, </i>I had little contact with&nbsp;the church until recently.&nbsp;<br><br><b>I Was Not Really Alone&nbsp;<br></b>From the time I sobered up until I stopped my private counseling&nbsp;practice in 1988, nearly four thousand people sought my&nbsp;help with the problems in their lives. Listening to their stories,&nbsp;along with my conversations with friends, made it abundantly&nbsp;clear that I was not alone in my moral confusion. Either people&nbsp;rigidly followed the Bible or held the doctrines of their family religious&nbsp;preference or they floundered. Even those who acted as if&nbsp;they knew the truth about moral goodness were struggling with&nbsp;their marriages, their children, being honest about their taxes,&nbsp;and the specific demands of civic duty; they were horrified by the&nbsp;greed and shamelessness that surrounded them, but did nothing&nbsp;about it.&nbsp;<br><br>I heard people say things like &#x201c;Our child is on drugs and we&nbsp;don&#x2019;t know what to do,&#x201d; &#x201c;My husband is never home, and when&nbsp;he is at home, he won&#x2019;t talk about anything,&#x201d; &#x201c;Evil people seem&nbsp;to be making out better than good people,&#x201d; &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t find a church&nbsp;I feel comfortable in,&#x201d; &#x201c;I&#x2019;m struggling with the idea of a loving&nbsp;God,&#x201d; &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have any real friends,&#x201d; &#x201c;I feel lonely and disconnected.&nbsp;I wish I had the absolute faith I had as a child,&#x201d; or &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve&nbsp;accepted Jesus as my personal savior but I can&#x2019;t give up the affair&nbsp;I&#x2019;m in.&#x201d; Other born-agains were cheating on their taxes or engaged&nbsp;in unethical business deals. The people I knew, counseled,&nbsp;and interacted with were all struggling with the complexity and&nbsp;ambiguity of moral choices.&nbsp;<br><br><b>What Had Gone Wrong?</b>&nbsp;<br>My own moral and religious education was rigorous. I remember&nbsp;memorizing the Ten Commandments and the Catholic&nbsp;catechism, and how I was called upon to recite these while a nun&nbsp;held a ruler poised to hit my open palms if I faltered. Once these&nbsp;rules were memorized, it was my duty to obey them without&nbsp;thought or question. In fact, questioning was considered a mark&nbsp;of disobedience and a lack of faith. Good moral behavior was&nbsp;simply a matter of obeying the rules with little or no understanding&nbsp;of many of them. The goal of my childhood moral teaching&nbsp;was to make me virtuous. But this way of teaching moral values,&nbsp;based as it was on blind obedience, did not make me virtuous.&nbsp;Nor did it make my friends or the people I counseled (religious or&nbsp;otherwise) virtuous.&nbsp;<br><br>What confused me was that the choices that challenged me as&nbsp;a moral person were often <i>not </i>clear and certain. If moral law&nbsp;were a system of absolute rules, there would be no need to deliberate&nbsp;or anguish over what choice was the best for me to make;&nbsp;there would be no need for freedom of choice. But living a good&nbsp;life involved complexity, ambiguity, and risk, and I often found&nbsp;myself puzzled.&nbsp;<br><br><b>Questions Raised by the&nbsp;Magnificent Moral Moments&nbsp;<br></b><br><br>As the novelist George Eliot says in the quotation at the beginning&nbsp;of this introduction, &#x201c;The mysterious complexity of our&nbsp;life is not to be embraced by maxims.&#x201d; I can illustrate this mysterious&nbsp;complexity by looking again at the magnificent moral moments&nbsp;with which I started this book. Each one makes a&nbsp;statement about goodness and virtue, but at the same time, each&nbsp;one raises new questions that must be dealt with.&nbsp;<br><br><i>The Fire Department Culture</i>&nbsp;<br>William Feehan&#x2019;s description of the &#x201c;fire department culture&#x201d;&nbsp;underscores the fact that many people have a desire for goodness&nbsp;that transcends material rewards. They have a caring will and an&nbsp;appetite for service; their priority is to help their fellow human&nbsp;beings. But can we say that every person who becomes a firefighter&nbsp;has this caring will? I know some who do not seem to be&nbsp;people of goodwill. The real question is, <i>how </i>is this desire and&nbsp;appetite for goodness created? How do we educate people in a&nbsp;way that will nurture and develop a passionate desire for goodness?<br><br><i>&nbsp;Ruby Bridges&nbsp;<br></i>Ruby Bridges&#x2019; strength seems to have come from her religious&nbsp;beliefs. But could those religious beliefs alone sustain this&nbsp;six-year-old girl? One answer is that Ruby was securely attached&nbsp;to her mother, who had a deeply committed religious faith, and&nbsp;both Ruby and her mother were part of a cohesive church community&nbsp;headed by a respected pastor. It was the mutuality of her&nbsp;secure bonding to her mother and her minister that gave Ruby&nbsp;the inner courage and strength to do what she did. Religious faith&nbsp;that begins in secure attachment to beloved source figures is unquestionably&nbsp;a source of moral strength.&nbsp;<br><br>But what if those source figures believe in a perfectionist and&nbsp;cruelly punishing God, as Susan Krabacher&#x2019;s mother did, using&nbsp;that belief to abuse Susan? What if people&#x2019;s religious bonding&nbsp;leads them to believe in a holy war that offers them a sure place in&nbsp;heaven if they fly their planes into the Twin Towers and the&nbsp;Pentagon, as the terrorist pilots of September 11, 2001, believed?&nbsp;Can that form of religious bonding be a source of moral goodness?&nbsp;Do we have any objective way to judge what is good or bad&nbsp;religion? Why do so many religions come to believe that their&nbsp;way is the only righteous way?&nbsp;<br><br><i>Maria Montessori</i>&nbsp;<br>Maria Montessori brought forth the innate intelligence and&nbsp;goodness in the children she taught by creating a special kind of&nbsp;environment. But can environment alone be the source of virtue?&nbsp;The Nazis tried to shape environments that would create a master&nbsp;race&#x2013;and spawned untold horror and evil. My religious community&nbsp;was dedicated to spiritual development, but it could not&nbsp;contain the spiritual bankruptcy of my addiction. How can we&nbsp;find ways to create the environments that fulfill the promise of&nbsp;Montessori&#x2019;s work?&nbsp;<br><br><i>Conscience and Civil Disobedience&nbsp;<br></i>Henry David Thoreau, who refused to pay his poll tax, modeled&nbsp;a conscience that superseded blind obedience to civil law.&nbsp;Hugh Thompson and his comrades also went beyond official&nbsp;duty and military law by intervening at My Lai.&nbsp;<br><br>But couldn&#x2019;t we argue that the terrorist pilots of 9/11 were&nbsp;also following their consciences? That they saw America as so&nbsp;sinful, materialistic, and degraded that their consciences demanded&nbsp;taking action against such evil? Thoreau&#x2019;s heirs might&nbsp;say that nonviolence is the solution, but Thompson protected&nbsp;the Vietnamese civilians by directing his crew to shoot any&nbsp;Americans who interfered. Which model should we follow, and&nbsp;when?&nbsp;<br><br><i>Abraham Lincoln&nbsp;<br></i>Abraham Lincoln had an ability (now described as emotional&nbsp;intelligence) to inspire and move others to action in order to&nbsp;achieve justice. I could have quoted any one of his famous&nbsp;speeches that played a part in changing the moral history of our&nbsp;country. But the emotional intelligence that Lincoln possessed&nbsp;was also possessed b...</p><h2>Roots of Steel: Boom and Bust in an American Mill Town</h2><p>When Deborah Rudacille was a child growing up in the working-class town of Dundalk, Maryland, a worker at the local Sparrows Point steel mill made more than enough to comfortably support a family. But in the decades since, the decline of American manufacturing has put tens of thousands out of work and left the people of Dundalk pondering the broken promise of the American dream.<br>&nbsp;<br>In <i>Roots of Steel, </i>Rudacille combines personal narrative, interviews with workers, and extensive research to capture the character and history of this once-prosperous community. She takes us from Sparrows Point&#x2019;s nineteenth-century origins to its height in the twentieth century as one of the largest producers of steel in the world, providing the material that built America&#x2019;s bridges, skyscrapers, and battleships. Throughout, Rudacille dissects the complicated racial, class, and gender politics that played out in the mill and its neighboring towns, and details both the arduous and dangerous work at the plant and the environmental cost of industrial progress to the air and waterways of the Maryland shore.<br>&nbsp;<br>Powerful, candid, and eye-opening, <i>Roots of Steel </i>is a timely reminder, as the American economy seeks to restructure itself, of the people who inevitably have been left behind.</p><p><b>Deborah Rudacille</b> is a science writer and the author of <i>The Riddle of Gender: Science, Activisim, and Transgender Rights</i> and <i>The Scalpel and the Butterfly: The War Between Animal Research and Animal Protection.</i> She lives in Baltimore, Maryland.PATRIOTS <br>&nbsp;<br>In Dundalk, Independence Day is a sacred celebration&#x2014;its holy feast beer and hard-shell crabs, and its central ritual the biggest parade in the state. Stars-and-stripes bunting or a flag drapes from every house, and families set out their lawn chairs the night before to secure a spot along the parade route. At nine in the morning, earsplitting sirens from the fire trucks open the parade, followed by the thrumming of drums from marching bands and the steady shuffling of veterans&#x2019; groups. Hand-painted banners proclaiming let freedom ring flap above local residents in colonial costumes riding on the floats of civic and church groups. <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Whenever the governor or members of Congress come to Dun�dalk for the parade, they always talk about the American pride,&#x201d; said John Olszewski Jr., a twenty-six-year-old state delegate, who, like me, grew up in this blue-collar community just outside Baltimore. I once marched in the Independence Day parade myself as a clumsy eleven-year-old majorette prone to dropping her baton, but I still remember my pride and excitement as I high-stepped up and down the leafy streets in my green-and-white uniform, for once a participant rather than an observer. <br>After the parade, everyone follows the charred aroma of pit beef and the sweet scent of fried dough to nearby Heritage Park, where a three-day festival provides an opportunity to run into old friends, classmates, and neighbors. People who grew up in Dundalk tend to come home for the holiday in the same way that others return for Thanksgiving, Passover, or Christmas. It is, as Olszewski pointed out, &#x201c;the first day of the year.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>Dundalk&#x2019;s flamboyant celebration of the Fourth is rooted in its history. A few miles east of the parade route, a band of citizen soldiers fought off British troops headed for Baltimore during the War of 1812. The invaders were repulsed by land and by sea in the battle memorial�ized in our national anthem. In the twentieth century, tens of thou�sands of Americans poured into the community from Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, the Carolinas, the Midwest, and Appalachia to work in industries critical to national defense&#x2014;shipbuilding, steel�making, and aviation&#x2014;during World War II. <br>&nbsp;<br>Many of those war workers remained, joining the European immi�grants and Southern migrants drawn to town by the manufacturing jobs that gave Baltimore its iconic image as the hardworking, hard-drinking working-class oasis lovingly parodied by its native son film�maker John Waters. &#x201c;You can look far and wide, but you&#x2019;ll never discover a stranger city with such extreme style,&#x201d; Waters once said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s as if every eccentric in the South decided to move North, ran out of gas in Baltimore, and decided to stay.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>Waters&#x2019;s description of the city goes double for the working-class district below its southeastern border, whose residents have long been the butt of local jokes for their extreme accents, hard dirty jobs, and retro tastes in music, fashion, and home d�cor. Growing up there gave me an enduring appreciation for Lynyrd Skynyrd that is hard to explain to those with more sophisticated musical tastes, and I loved Pabst Blue Ribbon beer long before urban hipsters wearing trucker hats adopted it as their brew of choice a few years ago. My father always had a six-pack of Pabst in our avocado-green refrigerator in the seventies. <br>&nbsp;<br>The mullet, stonewashed jeans, and dark wood paneling never went out of style in Dundalk. But it was there that I learned the virtues of hard work, community, and family. My paternal forebears arrived in the 1920s, and my maternal grandparents&#x2014;first-generation Italian Americans&#x2014;during World War II. Most of them worked at one time or another at the colossal Sparrows Point steelworks or its shipyards rimming Baltimore harbor, just a few nautical miles from the broad waters of the Chesapeake Bay. <br>&nbsp;<br>Grover Cleveland was president when the Pennsylvania Steel Company broke ground at Sparrows Point in 1887. The works and company town grew slowly, surviving recessions and market down�turns until shortly before the United States entered World War I. Flush with money from arms sales to the warring nations of Europe, Bethlehem Steel Corporation, Pennsylvania Steel&#x2019;s rival, bought the Point in 1916, inheriting its Chesapeake works and company town. From its earliest days Sparrows Point was the most racially diverse steel mill in the country&#x2014;but in those days diversity meant native-born whites on top, immigrants and blacks on the bottom. <br>&nbsp;<br>The company long recruited African American men from Vir�ginia, the Carolinas, and farther south. &#x201c;It provided a great foundation for folks who were making that transition from farmland to big-city life,&#x201d; said Deidra Bishop, the director of community affairs for East Baltimore for the Johns Hopkins Institutions. Bishop&#x2019;s grand�father, born in 1905, and various uncles worked at the Point. &#x201c;For my family it provided a very good life&#x2014;one that was not fraught with eco�nomic uncertainty. And it provided a circle of friendship for the men as well.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>That was true for white men like my Virginia-born grandfather too. Born in the shadows of the Shenandoah Mountains, he came to Sparrows Point looking for work in 1927, roomed with my great-grandparents, and married their daughter. They had five sons together, and the first three, including my father, were born in &#x201c;the bungalows&#x201d;&#x2014;tiny workers&#x2019; cottages on the edge of the company town. <br>&nbsp;<br>Southern roots were shared by many in the town, yet barely a generation after the Civil War, the sons of rebels and the sons of slaves were toiling together on Sparrows Point, a workingman&#x2019;s utopia conjured by a former Union major. &#x201c;Blacks and whites got along good,&#x201d; in the mills and town, eighty-year-old Lee Douglas Jr., who followed his father and uncles from South Carolina to the Point, told me in 2006. &#x201c;Only thing was, whites didn&#x2019;t want anybody promoting to their jobs.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>Work, family, and community were tightly braided together on Sparrows Point, where an employee needed a letter from his foreman to rent a house and where three generations of some families lived sur�rounded by coke ovens, open hearth furnaces, rolling mills, and enor�mous piles of limestone and coal. During the Great Depression, Bethlehem let laid-off workers and their families stay in their company houses and charge groceries at the company store. The United Steel�workers of America&#x2014;voted into the plant in 1941&#x2014;also &#x201c;really helped carry people&#x201d; during the steel strikes of the fifties and sixties, Ed Gor�man, a retired steelworker and union vice president, told me, by giving rent money to those in danger of losing their homes in nearby Dundalk and Baltimore and groceries to those who couldn&#x2019;t afford to feed their families. That commitment bred a fierce loyalty to the company and the union. <br>&nbsp;<br>Year after year, the ovens, furnaces, and finishing mills of the great works on the Chesapeake belched fire and smoke, crafting the ships and armaments that helped win World Wars I and II and churning out the raw steel and finished products that were the backbone of postwar America. In 1959 Sparrows Point claimed the title of the largest steel�works in the world. By then, Bethlehem (known locally as &#x201c;Bethlem&#x201d;) employed over forty thousand Maryland residents at its steelworks and shipyards, and the fortunes of thousands of small businesses through�out the state were tied to Sparrows Point. <br>&nbsp;<br>Steelworkers were among the best paid of all Baltimore&#x2019;s industrial workers in the postwar boom, and their union wages sent many chil�dren of steel like me to college. But by 1985 the American steel indus�try was on the ropes, and on the Point, as elsewhere, jobs were cut, layoffs were made permanent, and mills were closed. There is still a steelworks on Sparrows Point today, but it employs fewer than three thousand people, compared with the thirty-six thousand who worked on-site at its peak. Employees endured four changes of ownership from 2003 to 2008, as globalization and consolidation reshaped the industry. <br>&nbsp;<br>Still, those who survived the upheaval were luckier than most. Until the recent recession, the wages of some hourly workers were topping $100,000 a year. &#x201c;They are making more money than we ever made,&#x201d; LeRoy McLelland Sr., a Bethlehem retiree, told me in the run-up to the 2008 presidential election. &#x201c;But there are less people making it.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>McLelland labored for forty-two years in the tin mill at Sparrows Point. Like a lot of Bethlehem retirees, he is &#x201c;bitter, very bitter&#x201d; about the company&#x2019;s 2001 bankruptcy and subsequent sale of assets to the private-equity-funded International Steel Group. That deal stripped retirees of health and life insurance, liquidated their company stock, and cut deeply into many pensions, which were taken over by the fed�erally backed Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. Shorn of fiscal responsibility for Bethlehem&#x2019;s retirees, ISG became hugely profitable, netting its investors billions when ISG was folded into the global steel goliath ArcelorMittal two years later. The retirees have neither for�given nor forgotten the Bethlehem and ISG executives and bank�ruptcy judge who sealed the deal. <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;We looked forward to retirement as something we would enjoy,&#x201d; McLelland said, &#x201c;not worry from month to month about whether the PBGC could afford our pensions, whether Social Security is still gonna be there kicking in a dollar or two, whether Medicare is still going to be available. It&#x2019;s a daily fear t...</p><h2>Liar&#39;s Oath</h2><p>High heroic adventure from Moon, author of The Deed of Paksenarrion and co-author of Sassinak and Generation Warriors.

This stirring book by Louis E. LaGrand, Ph.D., a pioneer in after-death communication (ADC) research, guides you through a common human experience which can be both astounding and empowering if you know how to interpret it. <br> <br><i>Restore your hope and faith, and ease the process of mourning. </i>With a knowledge that personality and love continues after physical death, hope and faith for the future becomes stronger and mourning becomes a transition in your life instead of a block to future development. <br> <br><i>Learn how to assist and support someone who has an after-death contact. </i>We live in an age of cynicism and skepticism. When a person in mourning has communication with a deceased loved one, it can cause surprise and even shock by countering those preconceptions. This book shows you how to help people through this experience. <br> <br><i>Assess whether your own ADC experience was an authentic contact. </i>If you believe strongly in the continuation of life after death, you may mistake a common experience for something extraordinary. This book will help you determine if your contact was real or wish fulfillment. <br> <br><i>Explore the nine types of contact experiences. </i>These include dreams of the deceased, certain sounds or touches, and a third party who becomes the messenger between you and the beyond. <br> <br><i>Learn how others have used their contact with a deceased loved one to heal their grief and move on with their lives. </i>This book consolidates over ten years of solid research and hundreds of documented case studies to help guide you on your own path. <br> <br>For healing, hope, and comfort, read this book. <br> <br></p><p>Louis LaGrand makes great strides toward removing the shroud of mystery from a subject with which everyone should be acquainted. Although a self-described skeptic, LaGrand has come to a conclusion in favor of the reality of after-death communication, and stresses its benefits for those in grief, those attempting to comfort the grieving, and those who simply want a better understanding of their mortality and what waits for them beyond death.

Hot young female pop stars wearing provocative clothing and dancing suggestively while singing songs with sexual and sometimes violent lyrics. These products are marketed aggressively to our children; these stars are held up for our young daughters to emulate&#x2013;and for our sons to see as objects of desire.<br><br>Popular culture and technology inundate our children with an onslaught of mixed messages at earlier ages than ever before. Corporations capitalize on this disturbing trend, and without the emotional sophistication to understand what they are doing and seeing, kids are getting into increasing trouble emotionally and socially; some may even to engage in precocious sexual behavior. Parents are left shaking their heads, wondering: How did this happen? What can we do?<br><br>So Sexy So Soon is an invaluable and practical guide for parents who are fed up, confused, and even scared by what their kids&#x2013;or their kids&#x2019; friends&#x2013;do and say. Diane E.

Instead, they offer parents essential, age-appropriate strategies to counter the assault. For instance:<br><br>� Help your children expand their imaginations by suggesting new ways for them to play with toys&#x2013;for example, instead of &#x201c;playing house&#x201d; with dolls, they might send their toys on a backyard archeological adventure.<br>� Counteract the narrow gender stereotypes in today&#x2019;s media: ask your son to help you cook; get your daughter outside to play ball.<br>� Share your values and concerns with other adults&#x2013;relatives, parents of your children&#x2019;s friends&#x2013;and agree on how you&#x2019;ll deal with TV and other media when your children are at one another&#x2019;s houses.<br><br>Filled with savvy suggestions, helpful sample dialogues, and poignant true stories from families dealing with these issues, So Sexy So Soon provides parents with the information, skills, and confidence they need to discuss sensitive topics openly and effectively so their kids can just be kids.</p><p>Diane E.

But today, it has gotten even more difficult. A 2002 survey by an organization called Public Agenda found that 76 percent of parents felt it was a lot harder to raise children today than when they were growing up, and 47 percent reported that their biggest challenge was trying to protect their children from negative societal influences, including disturbing and confusing images, violence, and age-?inappropriate messages appearing in the media.<br><br>How would you have answered this survey? Are you, too, having a hard time trying to protect your children from negative influences? Are you finding it difficult to set and enforce limits on the media that your children are exposed to&#x2014;to determine how much, when, and what? As parents, you are often told that it&#x2019;s your job to &#x201c;just say no&#x201d; to all of the inappropriate content out there, and that this will solve the problem. But just saying no won&#x2019;t solve the problem, and anyway, you can&#x2019;t say no to everything!<br><br>Instead, we simply have to deal with the popular culture in our children&#x2019;s lives, often at the most unexpected times, in unforeseen ways, and whether we want to or not. This book is designed to help you do just that. And in order to be able to do so, the first order of business is to examine and recognize when and how the new sexualized childhood is influencing children from a young age.<br><br>Several recent books and news and research reports have expressed concern about today&#x2019;s sexual attitudes and behavior of many adolescents, and increasingly even tweens (eight-? to twelve-?year-? olds). These accounts often make it seem as if the behavior in question suddenly appears out of a vacuum when children enter high school (or middle school). Rarely do we hear about what was happening in the early years that paved the way for what is happening with teens.<br><br>There is a lot going on in children&#x2019;s lives around issues of sexuality and sexiness that is important for the caring adults in their lives to recognize. The following stories from parents and teachers make it very clear that if we are to understand and deal with the sexualization of childhood, we must begin our efforts with very young children.<br><br>CRYING IN THE BATHTUB<br><br>Jennifer reported that one evening not long ago, her seven-?year-?old daughter Hannah began crying in the bathtub. Alarmed, Jennifer asked what was wrong. Hannah responded, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m fat! I&#x2019;m fat! I want to be pretty like Isabelle&#x2014;sexy like her! Then Judd would like me too!&#x201d; Jennifer knew Isabelle, a very thin, very popular girl in Hannah&#x2019;s class who wore &#x201c;stylish&#x201d; clothes that Jennifer thought were inappropriate for a seven-?year-?old. Jennifer put her hand on Hannah&#x2019;s shoulder and said she liked Hannah&#x2019;s body&#x2014;it was a wonderful body for a seven-?year-?old and she certainly ?didn&#x2019;t need to lose weight. But Hannah continued to cry and to say that she wanted to go on a diet. Jennifer felt uncertain about what to say or do next. In her view, Hannah had a normal body for a seven-?year-?old girl. Jennifer thought it must be abnormal for such a young child to be thinking about diets, let alone wanting boys to like her for being &#x201c;pretty&#x201d; and &#x201c;sexy.&#x201d; But, normal or not, Jennifer saw that Hannah was truly concerned and distressed, and she wanted to do something to help.<br><br>As Jennifer strove to understand Hannah&#x2019;s outburst, she was tempted to put a lot of the blame on Hannah&#x2019;s friends, who were becoming increasingly influential and important to her. Recently, Hannah had come home from a playdate talking about having had a fashion show with her friend&#x2019;s Bratz dolls. Jennifer was concerned that when Hannah and her friends played together they often acted out going on &#x201c;dates&#x201d; and having weddings with their Barbie dolls, but she was truly horrified by the time they spent at other houses with Bratz dolls&#x2014;by their name, their anorexic-?looking bodies, their overt sexuality and hooker?like wardrobe, as well as by the focus on shopping and appearance as the point of the play. When she voiced her reservations about Hannah&#x2019;s having the dolls, Hannah said that everyone else had them and that she loved playing with them at other children&#x2019;s houses.<br><br>She and her friends liked dressing them up and having them go shopping and out on dates. Although Jennifer ?didn&#x2019;t give in, she ? wasn&#x2019;t sure what she would do when Hannah&#x2019;s birthday arrived the following month. She was certain some other girls would give these dolls to Hannah as gifts. Even if Jennifer took them away, she knew Hannah would continue to play with them at her friends&#x2019; homes. Recently, Hannah had begun to nag about joining the Bratz website, an online community where kids can play and buy things for their Bratz dolls in cyberspace, along with other children who are logged on.<br><br>Deep down, however, Jennifer realized that what worried her most was where this interest in appearance, popularity, and sexiness would lead. If Hannah was dissatisfied with her body at the age of seven, she wondered how she might feel at thirteen. Jennifer had seen news stories about an increase in precocious sexual behavior among children and teens, and she knew that eating disorders were on the rise, even among little girls. Were Hannah&#x2019;s tears about her body the first sign of such trouble for her? What was the relationship between concerns about body image and sexuality? And what did she mean by being &#x201c;sexy&#x201d; anyway? Knowing how high the stakes were, Jennifer felt almost desperate to find the right way to respond. But she was upset with herself for feeling unsure, even anxious, about knowing the right thing to say or do.<br><br>PROFESSIONAL WRESTLING GIRLS<br><br>Nora, a highly experienced kindergarten teacher, told us about an incident with a child that left her scrambling to figure out how to respond. In his daily school journal, five-?year-?old James had made a drawing of what looked to Nora like a woman, with long hair and bright red lips as well as big wavy circles on her chest that looked like breasts. Next to the drawing he had written the letter W over and over again. Nora asked him to tell her about his picture. She was caught off guard when James explained that his drawing was of &#x201c;a professional wrestling girl with big boobies.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;At first I thought he was trying to be fresh, to be a wise guy, but I caught myself before I reacted too harshly,&#x201d; Nora reported. &#x201c;I took a deep breath and tried to think through how to respond. I decided to start with a question.&#x201d; (This is almost always a good way to start when you&#x2019;re not quite sure what to say.) So Nora asked James what he knew about &#x201c;wrestling girls.&#x201d; He matter-?of-?factly replied with his eyes open wide, &#x201c;I saw her on TV last night with my [big] brother, Brett. He was babysitting! He let me stay up late and watch with him! It&#x2019;s a secret!&#x201d; She was glad she had asked him the initial question about what he knew about wrestling girls, because his response helped her begin to get a handle on what was going on for James.<br><br>Nora recalled that it was the look on James&#x2019;s face when he answered her, of both bravado and worry at the same time, that left her confused and concerned. She knew that James&#x2019;s parents were quite clear about limiting the amount and kind of media in his life. She knew how much James looked up to fourteen-?year-?old Brett and admired everything he did. She was pretty sure that James&#x2019;s parents would be distressed if they knew about Brett and James&#x2019;s secret! She was also pretty sure that if James shared the secret with her, he was asking for something, but what exactly was it?<br><br>Rather than try to work it all out with James at that moment, Nora decided to buy some time to think about what to do. So she said to James, &#x201c;It sounds like you saw things you ?hadn&#x2019;t seen before?.?.?.? things that were not really for kindergartners. I&#x2019;m glad you told me about your secret.&#x201d; James smiled and put his journal away.<br><br>After the event was over, there was a lot for Nora to consider. Why did James decide to disclose the secret to her and do it through his daily journal? Why did he choose to focus on the breasts? Did he know that focusing on them could be seen as provocative to his teacher or have sexual connotations? After all, what signifies sex to an adult might mean something quite different to a five-?year-?old. Was James trying to use his drawing to brag and feel more grown up about his having seen this grown-?up program? Or could he have made his drawing because he needed someone to talk to about it when he knew he ? couldn&#x2019;t reveal it to his parents because it was a secret? Was he testing Nora to see if she would get upset or angry, or looking to her to help him sort the experience out?<br><br>Nora began to think about the issue more broadly than just about James. If James drew his picture of the &#x201c;professional wrestling girl&#x201d; as a way of talking to an adult about something disturbing he saw on the screen, as Nora now thought he did, do other children also need such opportunities to process the graphic content they are seeing in media and popular culture? Well, then, whom are they talking to? How often do children end up seeing things their parents don&#x2019;t want them to see and then learn not to talk to adults about it? And when they do experience the forbidden fruit, what does it teach them about honesty and deceit and about the nature of their relationship with the important adults in their lives?<br><br>Finally, Nora started to feel better about how she had responded to James and realized she had learned an important lesson for her future teaching: Whether they&#x2019;re scared or want to feel grown-up and impress others with what th...</p><h2>Don&#39;t Know Much About History</h2><p>Using a question-and-answer format, this chronological overview offers an informal introduction to American history and features annotated reading lists and biographical profiles</p><p>Kenneth Davis's aim in this program, as it is in all the titles of this popular series, is to make learning relevant and fun. He succeeds marvelously. Davis has an easygoing style and a good sense of humor. And most importantly, he knows how to present the "big picture." His history of the United States is not a series of isolated incidents that happened long ago with no bearing on contemporary American life. Listening to this presentation, we recognize patterns, notice how problems of the past resurface in our own present, and realize that history is what makes us today. We are also presented with a look at American history that is far more honest than anything gleaned from traditional textbooks. Heroes and villains alike are presented, warts and all, and the "less savory moments" in America's past are discussed frankly. For, as Davis explains, "the real picture is much more interesting than the historical tummy tuck." The theme running through the program, from pre-European settlement to the Reagan years, is the struggle for power--the never-ending battle between the haves and have-nots that is the "essence of history." Six hundred years of history are broken up into manageable segments though a series of questions (spoken in a number of different voices to help distinguish them from the main narration), each of which is given a specific answer and then discussed in the context of its contemporary setting and perhaps past and future events. This is a crash course that focuses on the basics but will inspire listeners to want to know more--which is really what learning's all about.

S. Byatt observes in her new introduction to this edition of Edward FitzGerald's lyrical translation of Omar Khayyam's rubaiyat "forever changed the landscape of English poetry." The 250 copies of its 1859 first printing were left to molder in an obscure English bookshop , but two years later tha volume caught a young scholar's eye. Enchanted with his find, he distributed copies to his friends--among them Sir Richard Burton, Rossetti, Swinburne, Browning, and Tennyson, who later paid homage to the work in his own verse. The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam became a sensation in England and, perhaps partly because of the Victorian passion for "oriental" poetry, a smashing success in the United States as well. Further enhanced by A. S. Byatt's fresh insights and accompanied by 12 full-color ilustrations by Edmund Dulac--a French artist known for his imaginative, lively work in versions of The Arabian Nights and Shakespeare's <i>The Tempest</i>--this edition of <i>The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam</i> encompasses the very best of the old and the new.</p><p>An illustrated gift edition of the quatrains of Omar the tentmaker, which have more admirers today than ever before. Edward Fitzgerald's rendition stands as a monument to the translator's art.<p></p><p>Full-color photographs throughout.</p>Omar Khayyam was an eleventh-century Persian poet, mathematician, and astronomer. Renowned in his own time for his scientific achievements, his fame was reborn in the nineteenth century when Edward FitzGerald published a translation of his rubaiyat (quatrains in a style popular among Persian intellectuals of his day). Though FitzGerald happily confessed to taking liberties with Khayyam&#39;s verse, he brilliantly captured their timeless wisdom and passion. Khayyam died in the early twelfth century.</p><h2>Reclaiming Reality: A Critical Introduction to Contemporary Philosophy</h2><p>Originally published in 1989, <i>Reclaiming Reality</i> still provides the most accessible introduction to the increasingly influential multi-disciplinary and international body of thought, known as critical realism. It is designed to &#x201c;underlabour&#x201d; both for the sciences, especially the human sciences, and for the projects of human emancipation which such sciences may come to inform; and provides an enlightening intervention in current debates about realism and relativism, positivism and poststucturalism, modernism and postmodernism, etc.<br><br>Elaborating his critical realist perspective on society, nature, science and philosophy itself, Roy Bhaskar shows how this perspective can be used to undermine currently fashionable ideologies of the Right, and at the same time, to clear the ground for a reinvigorated Left. <i>Reclaiming Reality</i> contains powerful critiques of some of the most important schools of thought and thinkers of recent years&#x2014;from Bachelard and Feyerabend to Rorty and Habermas; and it advances novel and convincing resolutions of many traditional philosophical problems.<br><br>Now with a new introduction from Mervyn Hartwig, this book continues to provide a straightforward and stimulating introduction to current debates in philosophy and social theory for the interested lay reader and student alike. Reclaiming Reality will be of particular value not only for critical realists but for all those concerned with the revitalization of the socialist emancipatory project and the renaissance of the Marxist theoretical tradition.</p><p>Roy Bhaskar is the originator of the philosophy of critical realism, and the author of many acclaimed and influential works including A Realist Theory of Science, The Possibility of Naturalism, Scientific Realism and Human Emancipation, Reclaiming Reality and Dialectic: The Pulse of Freedom.

The climate disappointed me, but, though I ` found the country a study rather than a rapture, its interest exceeded my largest expectations. </p><p>This is not a gBook on Japan, h but a narrative of travels in Japan, and an attempt to contribute something to the sum of knowledge of the present condition of the country, and it was not till I had travelled for some months in the interior of the main island and in Yezo that I decided that my materials were novel enough to render the contribution worth making. From Nikko northwards my route ` was altogether off the beaten track, and had never been traversed in its entirety by any European. I lived among the Japanese, and saw their mode of living, in regions unaffected by European contact. As a lady travelling alone, and the first European lady who had been seen in several districts through which my route lay, my experiences differed more or less widely from those of preceding travellers; and I am able to offer a fuller account of the aborigines of Yezo, obtained by actual acquaintance with them, than has hitherto been given.

His classic coffee-table textbooks, <i>The New World Guide to Beer</i> and <i>Michael Jackson's Beer Companion</i>, offer highly regarded overviews of the world's styles, traditions, and techniques. Along with a television documentary series, numerous articles in trade publications, and extensive touring, Jackson's guides have established the <i>other</i> Michael Jackson as one of the great promoters of great beer.<p> With <i>Ultimate Beer</i>, Jackson homes in on the particulars: which beer, when, and why. After a concise overview of brewing ingredients and processes, Jackson explores a myriad of beers from every corner of the brewing world. His suggestions are organized by the situation in which they might best be enjoyed: from summer sippers to winter warmers, aperitifs to nightcaps. Enticing photography of each beer and its packaging accompanies Jackson's tasting notes, brief technical info, and product-specific tidbits. Then, Jackson indulges further with chapters on matching particular beers to particular dishes, and follows that up with a brief guide to cooking with beer.</p><p> The guiding principle of Jackson's writing--that which he shares with any beer enthusiast--is that beer, like wine, is best enjoyed when served at the right time, in the right conditions, and with the right dish. This book is Michael Jackson's very personal attempt to point the way to enjoying that <i>Ultimate Beer</i>. <i>--Todd Gehman</i></p>What makes a great beer? Why do beers taste the way they do? For any beer style, which are the best brews available? And which beers do you drink to accompany which foods? Michael Jackson, the world's leading authority on the fast-developing world of beer and brewing, answers these and many other questions in Beer, the ultimate visual guide to the subject for both novice and connoisseur. <p>THE BREWER'S ART While great wines are now appreciated the world over, the phenomenon of the beer connoisseur is relatively new. Yet great beers, created by master brewers from four basic ingredients - grains, hops, malt, and water - easily compare in variety, character, and texture with their better-known, grape-based counterparts. In this book, Michael Jackson examines more than 450 beers from around the world, explaining why they are superlative in their field and deserving of a connoisseur's attention. A Beer for Every Occasion Whether you are looking for a thirst-quencher, an alternative to champagne, an appetizer, or a nightcap, Michael Jackson recommends exactly the right beer for the occasion, with many other examples that you can try.</p></p><h2>Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King v. 3</h2><p>Following THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING and THE TWO TOWERS, a third title in the epic fantasy sequence THE LORD OF THE RINGS, in which men, dwarves, elves and ents come together to do battle against the Dark, while Frodo and Sam push further into Mordor in order to destroy the One Ring.</p><p>THE GREATEST FANTASY EPIG OF OUR TIME<p>While the evil might of the Dark Lord Sauron swarmed out to conquer all Middle-earth, Frodo and Sam struggled deep into Mordor, seat of Sauron's power.

First, it reveals the extraordinary and innovative efforts now being made by companies and organizations&#x2014;and by individuals&#x2014;to solve problems and save lives both &#x201c;down the street and around the world.&#x201d; Then it urges us to seek out what each of us, &#x201c;regardless of income, available time, age, and skills,&#x201d; can do to help, to give people a chance to live out their dreams.<br><br>Bill Clinton shares his own experiences and those of other givers, representing a global flood tide of nongovernmental, nonprofit activity. These remarkable stories demonstrate that gifts of time, skills, things, and ideas are as important and effective as contributions of money. From Bill and Melinda Gates to a six-year-old California girl named McKenzie Steiner, who organized and supervised drives to clean up the beach in her community, Clinton introduces us to both well-known and unknown heroes of giving. Among them:<br><br>Dr. Paul Farmer, who grew up living in the family bus in a trailer park, vowed to devote his life to giving high-quality medical care to the poor and has built innovative public health-care clinics first in Haiti and then in Rwanda;<br>a New York couple, in Africa for a wedding, who visited several schools in Zimbabwe and were appalled by the absence of textbooks and school supplies. They founded their own organization to gather and ship materials to thirty-five schools. After three years, the percentage of seventh-graders who pass reading tests increased from 5 percent to 60 percent;'<br>Oseola McCarty, who after seventy-five years of eking out a living by washing and ironing, gave $150,000 to the University of Southern Mississippi to endow a scholarship fund for African-American students;<br>Andre Agassi, who has created a college preparatory academy in the Las Vegas neighborhood with the city&#x2019;s highest percentage of at-risk kids. &#x201c;Tennis was a stepping-stone for me,&#x201d; says Agassi. &#x201c;Changing a child&#x2019;s life is what I always wanted to do&#x201d;;<br>Heifer International, which gave twelve goats to a Ugandan village. Within a year, Beatrice Biira&#x2019;s mother had earned enough money selling goat&#x2019;s milk to pay Beatrice&#x2019;s school fees and eventually to send all her children to school&#x2014;and, as required, to pass on a baby goat to another family, thus multiplying the impact of the gift.<br><br>Clinton writes about men and women who traded in their corporate careers, and the fulfillment they now experience through giving. He writes about energy-efficient practices, about progressive companies going green, about promoting fair wages and decent working conditions around the world. He shows us how one of the most important ways of giving can be an effort to change, improve, or protect a government policy. He outlines what we as individuals can do, the steps we can take, how much we should consider giving, and why our giving is so important.<br><br>Bill Clinton&#x2019;s own actions in his post-presidential years have had an enormous impact on the lives of millions. Through his foundation and his work in the aftermath of the Asian tsunami and Hurricane Katrina, he has become an international spokesperson and model for the power of giving.<br><br>&#x201c;We all have the capacity to do great things,&#x201d; President Clinton says. &#x201c;My hope is that the people and stories in this book will lift spirits, touch hearts, and demonstrate that citizen activism and service can be a powerful agent of change in the world.&#x201d;</p><p><b>WILLIAM JEFFERSON CLINTON,</b>&nbsp;42nd President of the United States, is founder of the&nbsp;Bill, Hillary &amp; Chelsea Clinton Foundation.A few years ago Sheri Saltzberg and Mark Grashow of New York, recently retired from public health administration and teaching, went to Zambia for a wedding. Their son suggested they go to Zimbabwe to visit a family that had befriended him and to see Victoria Falls. While they were there, they visited several schools and were appalled to see that there were no textbooks, empty libraries, no science equipment, no basic school supplies, and often no school breakfast or lunch.When they got home they founded their own NGO, the U.S.-Africa Children's Fellowship, and formed a partnership with the Zimbabwe Organization of Rural Associations for Progress, which had been working since 1980 to help improve the economy and education in individual communities.Over the next two years, they located thirty-five U.S. schools to partner with thirty-five schools in Zimbabwe, and they've shipped four forty-foot containers to the schools, with more than 150,000 books, school supplies, toys, games, sports equipment, bicycles, clothing, sewing machines, agricultural tools, and other items. They raise funds for items needed but not donated&#x2013;school uniforms, locally printed books, and educational materials and scholarships.In the U.S. partner schools, Mark and Sheri try to give students an appreciation for what life is like for their counterparts in Zimbabwe. American kids learn that the kids in their partner school often get up at 5 a.m. to walk several miles to school, may well have nothing to eat, and may have lost one or both parents to AIDS. They also learn that many kids don't go to school at all because they can't afford the school fees, uniforms, or even a notebook and pencil; they have to work to support or stay home to care for a sick parent or younger sibling; or they don't have shoes and can't walk long distances in winter. The American children are empowered to take action&#x2014;collecting donations and writing letters to the Zimbabwean students.Mark and Sheri themselves fly to Zimbabwe as each shipment arrives and help distribute the donations to the schools. "The effects of the shipment have far exceeded anything we dreamed of" says Mark. "For the first time, students can take books home to read. Five percent of the kids in the seventh grade used to pass reading tests; now it's 60 percent. Three years ago, only one student in his district passed his A-level exams for university. This year, thirty-eight students passed. There are now art and sewing classes. Soccer flourishes because there's an abundance of soccer balls. Attendance in many kindergartens has increased threefold due to the introduction of toys. In September we'll increase the schools we partner with from thirty-five to fifty." The program has proven so successful, there's now a waiting list of three hundred schools.Why did they do this? Mark says, "I believe that each of us has an obligation to level the playing field of life. Schools that have no books, communities without water, and people without access to medical care are not someone else's problem. We all have a capacity to make a difference somewhere. We just have to decide if we have the will to do it."To be connected to hundreds of nonprofits and organizations doing great work, view the resources guide at www.clintonfoundation.org/giving</p><h2>The Complete Drive-In</h2><p>Friday night at the Orbit Drive-in: a circus of noise, sex, teenage hormones, B-movie blood, and popcorn. On a cool, crisp summer night, with the Texas stars shining down like rattlesnake eyes, movie-goers for the All-Night Horror Show are trapped in the drive-in by a demonic-looking comet. Then the fun begins. If the movie-goers try to leave, their bodies dissolve into goo. Cowboys are reduced to tears. Lovers quarrel. Bikini-clad women let their stomachs&#x2019; sag, having lost the ambition to hold them in. The world outside the six monstrous screens fades to black while the movie-goers spiral into base humanity, resorting to fighting, murdering, crucifying, and cannibalizing to survive.

Keith Haring presented <i>Nina&#x2019;s Book of Little Things </i>to a friend&#x2019;s daughter on her seventh birthday. Now everybody can enjoy this classic book, back in print in a stylish new edition, featuring a back-page pocket for extra items and a band to keep everything safely stowed.</p><p>&#34;Nina&#39;s Book of Little Things&#34; is a complete copy of the original work presented to the daughter of an artist friend of Haring&#39;s on her 7th birthday. It consists of Haring&#39;s cartoon drawings and writings. The book is prefaced by a general set of instructions penned by Haring in which he calls on the reader to use the book. He goes on: &#34;Don&#39;t be afraid to draw in the book. Glue, paste, staple, sew, hammer, etc., etc., etc., tape, stick, etc., etc.&#34; Each of the double pages that follow carry their own playful, wity, and surprising instructions, accompanied by Haring&#39;s unmistakeable drawings.

Lynn Margulis is an ardent supporter of the Gaia hypothesis: the idea that due to the finely balanced interdependence of all life forms, the planet functions as a single , giant cell. Margulis argues that no organism is an island and that all are linked to each other. The Symbiotic Planet traces the evolution of planet earth from the origins of life and of sex to the emergence of &#39;hyperseas&#39; and eerie future she describes for humanity.</p><p><b>Lynn Margulis,</b> Distinguished Professor in the Department of Geosciences at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, has been a member of the National Academy of Sciences since 1983.

Each one focuses on some aspect of John's great visionary text, specifically analyzing its interpretation, representation, and manipulation in medieval culture, history, religion, art, and literature.</p><p>The book is divided into three sections. In the first part, six scholars of medieval history and thought detail the development of interpretations of the Book of Revelation from the earliest work of Tyconius and Augustine to the Franciscan and Dominican explanations of the later Middle Ages. In the second part, six art historians discuss the visual representation of the Apocalypse in medieval art from early Christian mosaics through late medieval and early Renaissance paintings and prints, including those of Albrecht Durer. Five essays by historians and literary historians in the third section focus on the wide variety of ways in which medieval literature, liturgy, and historiography were influenced by the Apocalypse.</p><p>Providing a wealth of new material, this book will enrich our understanding of some of the major themes of medieval intellectual, cultural, and religious history, and should serve as a model for future works on related topics.</p></p><p></p><h2>Wintering</h2><p>An extended personal essay on one New England winter chronicles the transformations of the natural world--plants, animals, and the earth itself--from autumn into early spring</p><p></p><h2>Start With the Soil: The Organic Gardener&#39;s Guide to Improving Soil for Higher Yields, More Beautiful Flowers, and a Healthy, Easy-Care Garden</h2><p>Describes the composition of good garden soil, stresses the need for humus, and offers advice on solving soil problems for vegetables, flowers, lawns, trees, and container gardens</p><p>Good things begin with good foundations, and so gardeners need instruction in soil maintenance. Yet this book is meant mainly for the super-serious gardener who won't mind wading through a volume that addresses soil in such detail that perhaps only a farmer would need to know it, and does so in words more appropriate for readers of an agricultural journal than for the general public. But the information is all here, in a remarkably thorough discussion that ranges from producing good general soil with humus and compost to strategies of soil chemistry and fertility, as well as covering particular issues of "problem" soils and the special needs of vegetables, flowers, lawns, trees and potted plants. Gershuny brings together some fascinating and practical material--about soil mixtures that will heighten color and aroma in flowers and increase production in plants bearing fruit, nuts and berries; a listing of the amazing arrays of manures and what they can accomplish; and the surprising materials that can serve as compost. These important points of entry to the book, however, are not so easy to find in the mass of information. Still, the charts and illustrations are wonderfully useful, and may alone be worth the price of the book.

Packer's <i>Drinking Coffee Elsewhere</i> has attracted as much book-world buzz as a triple espresso. Yet, surprisingly, there are no gimmicks in these eight stories. Their combination of tenderness, humor, and apt, unexpected detail set them apart. In the title story (published in the <i>New Yorker</i>'s summer 2000 Debut Fiction issue), a Yale freshman is sent to a psychotherapist who tries to get her--black, bright, motherless, possibly lesbian--to stop "pretending," when she is sure that "pretending" is what got her this far. "Speaking in Tongues" describes the adventures of an Alabama church girl of 14 who takes a bus to Atlanta to try to find the mother who gave her up. Looking around the Montgomery Greyhound station, she wonders if it has changed much since the Reverend King's days. She "tried to imagine where the 'Colored' and 'Whites Only' signs would have hung, then realized she didn't have to. All five blacks waited in one area, all three whites in another." Packer's prose is wielded like a kitchen knife, so familiar to her hand that she could use it with her eyes shut. This is a debut not to miss. <i>--Regina Marler</i><strong>ZZ Packer </strong>is the author of <em>Drinking Coffee Elsewhere</em> (2003). Frequently published in such journals as<em>The New Yorker</em>and<em>Granta</em>, she is at work on a novel,<em>The Thousands,</em>which explores the lives of former Louisiana slaves in forming a labor movement, as well as the fates of African-American "buffalo soldiers" assigned in the Southwest to battle the last Native American resistance force, the Apaches.

Boas completed his degree with a dissertation on the optical properties of water, before continuing his studies and receiving his doctorate in 1881. Boas became a professor of Anthropology at Columbia University in 1899 and founded the first Ph.D program in anthropology in America. He was also a leading figure in the creation of the American Anthropological Association (AAA). Franz Boas had a long career and a great impact on many areas of study.

The "justice of Zeus" turns out to be two things, the first basic, the second subsidiary: (1) something like natural law or "the divinely appointed order of the universe," an order not always or even usually open to human scrutiny, and (2) moral law, a concession to the insignificant creatures of a day that men are, whereby Zeus "punishes, late or soon, a man who has done injustice to another, either in his own person or in that of his descendants."&nbsp; Because Lloyd-Jones sees the first and basic notion of Dike as the prerequisite of the later rational speculation to which it led (smoothly and without violent discontinuities, as he claims), his book assumes the dimensions of Kulturgeschichte Griechenlands, and becomes the latest in a small but distinguished list of works with similarly broad scope . . ."<br><br> From:<br> Review<br> The Justice of Zeus by Hugh Lloyd-Jones<br> Review by: John Peradotto<br> The Classical Journal<br> Vol. 70, No. 3 (Feb. - Mar., 1975) , pp. 61-68<br> Published by: The Classical Association of the Middle West and South</p><p>Sir Peter Hugh Jefferd Lloyd-Jones FBA (21 September 1922 &#x2013; 5 October 2009) was a British classical scholar and Regius Professor of Greek at Oxford.</p><h2>Soul Re-Creation: Developing your Cosmic Potential</h2><p>Soul Re-Creation contains the advanced teachings of Spiritual Response research and clearing methods for past lives, subconscious memory and soul programs.

Now, seventy years have passed since the first War Between the States. The North American continent is locked in a battle of politics, economies, and moralities.

Charismatic, shrewd, and addicted to conflict, Featherston is whipping the Confederate States into a frenzy of hatred. Blacks are being rounded up and sent to prison camps, and the persecution has just begun. Featherston has forced the United States to give up its toeholds in Florida and Kentucky, and as the North stumbles through a succession of leaders, from Socialist Hosea Blackford to Herbert Hoover and now Al Smith, Featherston is feeling his might.

Weaving history and autobiography, Hopkins regales with an array of startling facts about the world's eating habits.<i>Strange Foods</i> begins with rat tales from the Roman Empire and imperial China and continues on to stories form locales where rat remains a mouth-watering hors d'oeuvre or hearty entr�e today. There are at least 40 serving suggestions for crocodile alone! And there are more than 250 photographs from acclaimed photographer Michael Freeman, whose aim is true and who eats what he shoots. This is gonzo food writing that's sure to change your mind, if not your palate.<br></p><p>Jerry Hopkins has published more than 1,000 magazine articles and 26 books, including three international best sellers, No One Here Gets Out Alive, The Lizard King: The Essential Jim Morrison, and Jimi Hendrix Experience. A correspondent and contributing editor to Rolling Stone magazine for nearly twenty years, Hopkins now resides in Bangkok, where he has developed a strong reputation as a travel writer, and writes regularly for publications such as The New York Times and Conde Nast Traveler. Michael Freeman has published 23 books on photography. His work has appeared internationally in such magazines as National Geographic, GQ, and Life.Jellyfish<p> In their natural state, as they go bobbing merrily along, carried by the wind and ocean tides, jellyfish offer an unlikely source of food. Like so many other food sources in this book, in addition to an unseemly appearance, many species have a nasty reputation for painfully intruding on human lives, in this case, stinging swimmers and waders enjoying the sea.</p><p> It's no surprise that many people think jellyfish are a strange thing to eat. The beast itself floats to a different drummer. They have been on the earth for more than 650 million years, going back pre-dinosaur and shark (and, some might say, rudely, given all that time, they still haven't developed much talent or personality). It gets its name from its "jelly bag," a sort of skin filled with gelatinous secretion that makes it more than 95% water-human beings, one of the other wettest creatures on earth, measure a little more than seventy percent-and it has no heart, brain, or bones, being held together by muscle fibers. Its stomach is connected directly to its mouth, the only opening in its body. </p><p> Jellyfish in its natural form is off-putting, but so are many other delicious foods. Once harvested and the tentacles are removes, and the large flat tops are dried, it looks no more threatening than a large dried mushroom. The most popular species reaches fifteen to twenty inches in diameter and when dried is sold in one pound bags. Preparation requires soaking them for about eight hours, changing the water two or three times. The blubbery flesh is then parboiled quickly and rinsed under cold water, and sliced thinly.</p><p></p></p><h2>Emotions &amp; Essential Oils, 2nd Edition: A Modern Resource for Healing</h2><p>Emotions &amp; Essential Oils, 2nd Edition: A Modern Resource for Healing</p><p></p><h2>Policeman Small (Lois Lenski Books)</h2><p>Policeman Small gets to see a lot of what goes on in town.

By the author of Balkan Ghosts. 15,000 first printing.</p><p>An analysis of the evolution of US policy toward the Middle East--as well as of the foreign-policy elite that guided it--that goes far deeper than the headlines. America's concern with the Middle East, says Kaplan (Soldiers of God, 1990, etc.), began in the 19th century with the missionaries who braved great hardship, with little success, to bring the Christian message to the area. Eventually, these missionaries concluded that education might be the best way of proselytizing--a conclusion that Kaplan calls ``probably the most inspired idea in the history of foreign aid.'' More sustained American interest in the Middle East developed only after WW II, and much of the subsequent history of the ``Arabists'' is tied up with Truman's decision to recognize the State of Israel despite the almost universal opposition of his foreign-policy advisors-- opposition that, according to Truman, smacked of anti-Semitism. Kaplan, himself Jewish, handles this controversy evenhandedly, and notes that then-Assistant Secretary of State Loy Henderson was remarkably prescient about the aftermath of our recognition of Israel: decades of constant trouble and expense, as well ``the rise of fanatic Mohammedanism'' of a kind ``not experienced for hundreds of years.'' In tracing the controversy over recognition, Kaplan relies particularly on interviews with leading Arabists, and he gives vivid pictures of an elite whose skills were developed by the sheer difficulty of mastering Arabic but who nonetheless have been regarded by critics like Francis Fukuyama as ``more systematically wrong'' than any other branch of the foreign service. The Arabists' story, Kaplan says, is one of dramatic successes (e.g., the extraction of the Falasha Jews from the Sudan, revealed here in all its truth perhaps for the first time) but of great failures as well (for instance, the failure to predict the true aims of Saddam Hussein). Full of fascinating, sometimes brilliant, insight into the politics of the area and its impact on those entrusted with US policy. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Kaplan turns his attention to the myths and realities of the State Department's Arabists: "men and women . . . who read and speak Arabic and who have passed many years of their professional lives . . . in the Arab world." Tracing the origins of the Arabist tradition to the Protestant missionary families who established schools and hospitals during the nineteenth century in Beirut, Cairo, eastern Turkey, western Iran, and the Saudi peninsula, Kaplan contrasts the idealism of Americans' initial involvements with the Arab world with the imperial machinations of "sand-mad Englishmen" such as T. E. Lawrence. After World War II, Arabists whose families had lived in the Middle East for generations hoped for stronger ties between the U.S. and the young Arab nations; however, the cold war and U.S. support for Israel dashed their hopes. <i>The Arabists</i> blends graceful, empathetic portraits of specific individuals with succinct descriptions of developing trends in U.S. politics and diplomacy and Mideast relations up to the Gulf War. A thoughtful, reflective analysis of a subject painfully immersed in controversy. <i>Mary Carroll</i></p><h2>Ambrose&#39;s Patriarchs: Ethics for the Common Man</h2><p>In this welcome new book Marcia L. Colish offers the only monograph-length study of the patriarch treatises of Ambrose of Milan (c. 340-397), in which he develops, for the first time in the patristic period, an ethics for the laity. Ambrose the ethicist has been viewed primarily as the author of advice to those with special callings in the church, such as priests, widows, and consecrated virgins. His views have been characterized as advocating asceticism and promoting a Platonic view of human nature, in which the body is a moral problem. Ambrose&#39;s patriarch treatises, argues Colish, are instead aimed at lay people who did not have special callings in the church, but who led active lives in the world as spouses, parents, heads of households, professionals, and citizens. These treatises reveal a different side of Ambrose and show that he developed an ethics of moderation based on an Aristotelian and Stoic anthropology, which he modified in the light of biblical ethics and St. Paul&#39;s view of human nature.</p><p>"The readers of this book will not be surprised by Marcia Colish. She has once again given us a succinct and crystal-clear condensation of a complex body of thought. But they will be surprised by Colish's Ambrose. This is not at all the world-denying romantic Platonist that many see him to have been. Colish's close attention to the Stoic groundwork of Ambrose's ethical thought, and to his careful modification of the views of his predecessors, recaptures him as the first Christian preacher prepared to present a coherent ethics for the average believer. Far from showing his preaching to have been a chapter in the rise of Christian ascetic extremism, Colish has shown us how to read Ambrose's sermons as a chapter in a more enduring (and, perhaps, more welcome) development&#x2014;the 'Romanization' of Christian moral thought, with all the this-worldly solidity which the word 'Roman' still invokes." &#x2014;Peter Brown, Princeton University<br><br> &#x201c;This is a significant study, by a distinguished scholar, of works that are often overlooked but that, as Marcia Colish ably demonstrates, challenge some widely held interpretations of Ambrose as a theologian, ethicist, and philosopher.

That is only one item of scandalous interest in an autobiography that resembles Billie Holiday's Lady Sings the Blues in its startling, brutal honesty. But, unlike celebrity autobiographies that mistake "juicy" anecdotes for self-revelation, Dancing on My Grave is also an intellectually stimulating portrait of the artist at war with tradition, with family, friends, lovers and colleagues, but most frustratingly, with herself. The 34-year-old Kirkland, who triumphed at the New York City Ballet and American Ballet Theater in the 1970s, reveals her one-time addiction to cocaine; that her affair with dancer Patrick Bissell was predicated on their mutual addiction to the drug; that both her romantic and artistic relationships with Baryshnikov were untenable because of his adolescent and unrelenting narcissism ("How was it possible that Misha's resources as an artist, so evident in performance, were different from those of his basic personality?"); that in 1981 she committed herself to a Westchester psychiatric hospital, even as she knew that her anorexia, bulimia and drug addiction were only symptoms of deeper emotional problems. The memoir also serves as a devastating critique of the American dance establishment that cannot be ignored. New York City Ballet founder George Balanchine (who gave Kirkland amphetamine "vitamins" on a tour of the U.S.S.R.) emerges as patronizing, vindictive, petty but still a genius. Through the 1970s and early 1980s, Kirkland nearly paid with her life for "the passivity and guilt instilled by the Balanchine system"a dance theater that valued speed and form over dramatic content. "Don't think, dance," Kirkland was told. The ballerina's disaffection with that dictum is at the heart of this book: "To speak through the dance, to articulate something beyond the steps, was the precise art for which I struggled." Kirkland spares neither the reader nor herself in this memoir full of poetic insights into art and life, and we must be grateful that the dancer, always "seen but not heard," has at last given her inner soul voice in this magnificent autobiography. 50,000 ad/promo. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.Prima ballerina Kirkland and her husband have written an emotional diatribe about Kirkland's dance career. The ballet equivalent of a "tell-it-all" Hollywood biography, this is a horror story of pain, anorexia, emotional difficulties, and casual sex, culminating in four years of cocaine addiction that brought her career to a standstill. At odds with both Balanchine and Baryshnikov in her insistence on putting her own dramatic interpretation into her roles, she is highly critical of Balanchine's training methods and Baryshnikov's partnering skills, which she says lacked finesse both on and off the stage. Her serious accusations that ballet training produces mindless mechanical dolls, and that the rigors of the life drive dancers to drug abuse, are undermined by her shrill, fragmented tone, making this a sad self-justification.

You could walk between the towns in an hour, but they could not feel further apart, for between them lie years of animosity.</p> <p>The townspeople of Les Salants say that if you kiss the feet of their patron saint and spit three times, something you've lost will come back to you. And so Madeleine, who grew up on the island, returns after an absence of ten years spent in Paris. She is haunted by this place, and has never been able to feel at home anywhere else.</p><p>But when she arrives, she will find that her father -- who once built fishing boats that fueled the town's livelihood -- has become even more silent than ever, withdrawing almost completely into an interior world. And his decline seems reflected in the town itself, for when the only beach in Les Salants washed away, all tourism drifted back to La Houssini�re.</p><p>Madeleine herself has been adrift for a long time, yet almost against her will she soon finds herself united with the village's other lost souls is a struggle for survival and salvation.</p></p><p>After three novels which centered around gastronomic pleasures, Joanne Harris's <i>Coastliners</i> focuses on more astringent joys. Sea, gritty sand, and adverse weather conditions replace <i>Chocolat</i>, <i>Blackberry Wine</i>, and <i>Five Quarters of the Orange</i>. Set on a small, blustery fishing island off the coast of France, it tells the story of Mado, a young woman who returns to her childhood home to find the local community torn apart by family feuds, bad tides, and murky political machinations. <p> Passionate, stubborn Mado, whose "head is full of rocks," tries to save the livelihoods of the villagers of Les Salants by urging them to work together to save the beach from erosion, both natural and man-made. The villagers, written with endearing panache by Harris, are an eccentric, curmudgeonly bunch, who eventually cooperate with the help of Flynn, a charismatic stranger with a shady past. He's not the only man of mystery in Mado's life; her father, taciturn Grosjean, has a secretive heart that's as "prickly and tightly layered as an artichoke," and local, wealthy businessman Brismand also seems to be hiding something. Mado does her best to unravel these mysteries, while attempting to keep a hold on her own sense of self in the claustrophobic, close community. It's not only the shore line that takes a buffeting. The villagers and the island are so vividly described that it's impossible not to become engrossed in Mado's story. <i>Coastliners</i> is a book about longing to belong, and Joanne Harris charts that emotional voyage compellingly. <i>--Eithne Farry, Amazon.co.uk</i></p><p>Joanne Harris is the author of seven previous novels&#x2014;<em>Chocolat</em>, <em>Blackberry Wine</em>, <em>Five Quarters of the Orange</em>, <em>Coastliners</em>, <em>Holy Fools</em>, <em>Sleep</em>, <em>Pale Sister</em>, and <em>Gentlemen &amp; Players</em>; a short story collection, <em>Jigs &amp; Reels</em>; and two cookbook/memoirs, <em>My French Kitchen</em> and <em>The French Market</em>.

Welcomed into the homes of rural people, including Purpechan, Chamulan, and Zinacantan Indians, as few have been before, Salvo was permitted the rare privilege of photographing their private and deeply personal home environments. Central to each interior was the altarcito, or home altar. These dazzling large-format color photographs depict the altars in all their glory and meticulous detail. Some are constructed for special holidays--Christmas or the Day of the Dead, for instance--while others commemorate beloved family members using photographs, mementoes, and the deceased&#39;s favorite foods. The essays provide the cultural and historic background to the practice of constructing domestic altars, linking the ancient traditions with modern customs.</p><p>Dana Salvo is an artist living in Gloucester, Massachusetts.

Married with two kids and another on the way, I was doing what I thought I should be doing&#x2014;working like hell to earn a living. The year was 1963 and minimum wage was a dollar an hour. I was doing better than that: $1.10. I was okay with that. I had a desk job as a neon sign designer at a small shop called Texas Neon. Still, my weekly take-home pay after taxes and deductions was only $37.50, hardly enough to make ends meet. I worried every day and prayed, hoping one of the kids wouldn&#x2019;t get sick. How would I pay the doctor?<br><br> One day, I got lucky. A woman by the name of Sally Pond came into the shop and asked us to design a small sign for her office building. She wanted it to read, &#x201c;The School of Personal Achievement.&#x201d; As she explained her business, my ears perked up. She promised that anyone who took the course and followed the teachings of Napoleon Hill and his seventeen principles of personal achievement would get rich. Every bit as rich as he or she wanted.<br><br> Napoleon Hill? Who was that? Was he French? Was he related to Bonaparte? Was he dead?<br><br> &#x201c;No,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;This man is alive, living in Chicago. And as far as I&#x2019;m concerned, he&#x2019;s more important than Napoleon Bonaparte. This Napoleon will make you a millionaire.&#x201d;<br><br> In about five minutes, Sally Pond signed me up. And in those five minutes, my life changed. Not only did I get a chance to design her sign, I got a chance to design my life, and to acquire the knowledge I would need to lead a happy life and earn millions. I borrowed the money to pay for the course, joining fifteen other would-be millionaires at the Napoleon Hill School of Personal Achievement. Those seventeen weeks in class changed my life forever.<br><br> Hill&#x2019;s mantra was: &#x201c;Whatever your mind can conceive and believe, you can achieve.&#x201d; I believed every word. After all, his philosophy was not just one man&#x2019;s opinion. It was the shared wis- dom distilled from the minds of hundreds of the most successful people in the world. Napoleon Hill had spent more than twenty years compiling this treasure. He had spent hours, days, and weeks interviewing presidents, heads of state, inventors, and captains of industry. His work was a gold mine of information and success secrets.<br><br> My eyes were as wide as baseballs. The excitement inside me was huge. Imagine. I could be rich! I could be happy! I could make important contributions to society by learning and applying Hill&#x2019;s seventeen principles of personal achievement! Even before the first day of class, something inside me began to change. For the first time in my life, instead of worrying, I was thinking positively about the future.<br><br> The course was taught in seventeen installments. Every Monday, we would report promptly at 5 pm, and each week we were introduced to a new lesson. With each lesson, we learned a new principle. During the first twenty minutes of instruction, we were shown a 16-mm movie of Mr. Hill giving an overview of the lesson of the week. Week one: Definiteness of Purpose. Week two: The Mastermind Alliance. And so on. Class discussion was encouraged, and the conversations were spirited. We had workbooks to fill out and homework to do. Sally invited successful people to guest lecture and tell their stories of how their dreams had come true by applying Hill&#x2019;s principles. Many of the students became good friends, though we didn&#x2019;t socialize much after class. We tended to rush home to do our homework and get ready for the following week.<br><br> Had I been older and more experienced, I might have been skeptical of the whole philosophy. I might have questioned some of it as being too simple, such as the idea that you can achieve whatever your mind believes you can achieve. I might have questioned some of the instruction as being too offbeat, such as the concept of autosuggestion, the idea that you can talk yourself into believing anything, good or bad. Being young and na�ve can be a great asset. For me, it was a blessing. I didn&#x2019;t question anything. My mind was open. I drank it all in.<br><br> Whatever your age, experience, or level of maturity, pretend you&#x2019;re a kid again as you read this book. Keep an open mind. Don&#x2019;t come on this journey carrying the baggage of cynicism and doubt. Understand that baggage of this sort is the by-product of experience and rationalism&#x2014;behaviors we learn as adults. This baggage is too heavy to take on our trip to success and riches. Lose it.<br><br> Also, soak up all seventeen principles. You may not master them all. That&#x2019;s okay. Several of the people I interviewed for this book (many of whom are disciples of Napoleon Hill and Think &amp; Grow Rich) tell me that they apply no more than a handful of these principles each day. But they do apply them each day. That&#x2019;s what&#x2019;s important. Looking back, I realize that I have mastered only four of them. Yet, those four were so powerful, they were all that I needed and exactly what I needed. Later in the book, I&#x2019;ll tell you which four I mastered and how they continue to work for me.<br><br> Latinos and Success<br><br> Perhaps you&#x2019;re reading this book because you are Latino or Hispanic. Perhaps you are simply curious about the almost fifty million of us who reside in the United States and Puerto Rico. Maybe you want insights into the one billion of us who inhabit the continents known as the Americas. Did you know that the Americas are two-thirds Latino?<br><br> Note that I use Latino and Hispanic interchangeably. Personally, I prefer &#x201c;Latino.&#x201d; I agree with the comedian George Lopez, who shies away from the term &#x201c;Hispanic&#x201d; because it has the word panic in it.<br><br> Why do Latinos need their own version of Think &amp; Grow Rich, a book that has been around since the 1930s and has helped turn tens of thousands of ordinary people into leaders and millionaires? Italians didn&#x2019;t get their own version. Jews didn&#x2019;t. Why Latinos?<br><br> Good question. Two reasons:<br><br> 1.No group of people is better prepared to take advantage of Think &amp; Grow Rich than Latinos.<br><br> 2.On the other hand, no group of people is more poorly prepared to take advantage of Think &amp; Grow Rich than Latinos.<br><br> Sound crazy? It&#x2019;s really not. Let me explain.<br><br> Latinos in the United States have a lot to be proud of. We are the largest minority population in the nation. That makes us big and powerful. We&#x2019;ve come a long way since the days when restaurants would hang signs that read, &#x201c;No Mexicans or Dogs Allowed.&#x201d;<br><br> Today, there&#x2019;s plenty of good news: Hispanic income is at an all-time high. So is our buying power, and also our home- ownership levels. Our entrepreneurial spirit is legend. Every year, Latinos start more small businesses than any other group of Americans. We have the political power that has helped elect two presidents. Latinos are big in popular culture, music, entertainment, and the arts. Many Anglos aspire to be Latino. It&#x2019;s wonderful!<br><br> Some of the news is not, however. Our high school- and college-completion rates are the lowest of any ethnic group. We earn less money per capita than non-Latinos. Few of us are represented on corporate boards or in top management. Our immigration woes still get national attention.<br><br> Professor Samuel P. Huntington of Harvard University wrote a book titled Who Are We? In it, he depicts Latinos as a menace to all that America has achieved and represents. He disagrees with my position that the Americano Dream is for everyone to share and says so in his book. &#x201c;[Sosa] is wrong,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;There is no Americano Dream. There is only an American Dream created by an Anglo-Protestant society. Mexican Americans will share in that dream and in that society only if they dream in English.&#x201d;<br><br> Who says Mexican Americans don&#x2019;t dream in English? We dream in two languages, and English is one of them. It is Dr. Huntington who is wrong. Dead wrong. Latinos are attracted to America for the same reason every other immigrant has ever been: for the opportunity to make it big, based on our own talent, heart, hard work, and initiative.<br><br> For all the press we get, good and bad, very little is known about who we really are. Truth is, we know precious little about ourselves. How many of us know that Hispanics settled in North America seventy-eight years before the Pilgrims ever landed at Plymouth Rock? Or that Spain and its territories such as Mexico and Cuba, in large part, financed the American Revolution? Or that Puerto Ricans, Mexicans, Cubans, and other Latinos together have earned more congressional medals of honor to date defending our country? How many Americans can name a dozen of the fifteen hundred cities and four states in the United States with Spanish names? We know the city of San Franciso by its Spanish name. Otherwise, we&#x2019;d call it St. Francis. The same is true for the state of Nevada. In English, it would be called Snowfall. Hispanics named those cities and states because we were in North America before the British. Spanish-speaking Americans comprise the third-largest Spanish-speaking &#x201c;country,&#x201d; right behind Mexico and Spain.<br><br> That&#x2019;s just the beginning. What&#x2019;s more important is who we are now, how we think, and how our success will impact this America.<br><br> The Latino Experience<br><br> Let&#x2019;s get down to business. Just who are Latinos? For starters, we are a complicated group&#x2014;an amalgamation of people from twenty-five countries throughout Mexico, South and Central America, and the Caribbean, as well as Spain, and Portugal. As we grow and become part of the mainstream, we become more complicated, more difficult to understand.<br><br> Some gringos (I use the term affectionately) think we are aliens. To many Latin Americans, we are some sort of gringo hybrid who has forsaken the mother country. Other minorities in the United States are easier to understand, perhaps because they share a common experience, and often a common injury. For Jewish Americans, it is the Holocaust. African Americans get their sense of identity and unity from slavery. Even non-minorities have their symbols: Texans have the Alamo, Southerners have Appomattox.<br><br> What do Latinos have? As Cantinflas, the Mexican comedian, used to say, &#x201c;All� est� el detalle.&#x201d; Loosely translated, this is a hedge that really means &#x201c;who knows?&#x201d; Our story is hard to define. Our injury is not apparent. Yet it must be there. Why else would we be labeled a minority even in cities like San Antonio where we have always been a majority? Why else would we have higher levels of poverty and lower levels of achievement?<br><br> The experts all have answers. Some say the situation is caused by the steady wave of new immigrants who enter this country poor and undereducated. Others say Latinos are inhibited by lower expectations of themselves and of their children that stem from their history and culture. Still others dismiss us as simple optimists who measure success differently. Roberto Suro, in his book Strangers Among Us, believes that whereas we may see ourselves as being respectful, American society sees us as being subservient. Raul Yzaguirre, founder of the National Council of La Raza, believes that the &#x201c;system&#x201d; works against Latinos and that prejudice and lack of adequate government funding is to blame.<br><br> Maybe they are all right. But there&#x2019;s something else that impacts our low economic status. My own research of the last twenty years indicates it may have to do with a lack of self-identity. And thus a lack of self-confidence. Did the conquest of the Indian by the Spaniards and Portuguese leave an imprint that makes us feel less worthy today? To explore this issue, we must peel back the onion. One layer at a time. Even if it hurts.<br><br> Noted theologian Father Virgilio Elizondo often makes this observation in his writings:<br><br> We are the mestizaje or &#x201c;mixture&#x201d; of the Spanish and the indigenous native of the Americas. As such, we were both the welcomers and the welcomed. We were both the explored and the explorers. We were both the settlers and the settled. We were both the conquered and the conquerors. We were both the victims and the victimizers. We are the mother and the father as well as the children of this land we call the USA.<br><br> And because our origin is so new&#x2014;500 years, compared to Europe&#x2019;s 48,000 years&#x2014;we were here to witness and record our own conception, as well as our own birth.<br><br> Pretty heady stuff, huh? Father Virgil is a genius (you&#x2019;ll find his story in the final chapter of this book). Examining his insights, two big things jump out at me:<br><br> 1.We share a uniquely Latino injury, the conquest. It produced an unconscious macho/servant dichotomy. We can be as tough as a conqueror one minute and meek as a slave the next. In public, many of us put on our subservient hats. At home, the macho steel helmet.<br><br> 2.We share a uniquely Latino characteristic. Our quiet but relentless energy and optimism arose from the need to survive in the face of recurring oppression.<br><br> Now let&#x2019;s see how we can make these observations work for us in terms of thinking and growing rich.<br><br> Making Think &amp; Grow Rich Work for You<br><br> The cultural baggage derived from our roots subtly influences our successes and failures. Our roots make us who we are. They determine our core values. These values dictate our beliefs, and our beliefs drive our behavior.<br><br> Are you carrying negative cultural baggage on your journey to riches? Are you carrying some you are unaware of?<br><br> To make Think &amp; Grow Rich work for you as a Latino, first understand what makes us tick:<br><br> 1.our unconscious servant/macho psyche<br><br> 2.our relentless energy and optimism<br><br> 3.our values compared to Anglo values<br><br> Let&#x2019;s explore these points, one at a time.<br><br> 1. Our Unconscious Servant/Macho Psyche<br><br> Many Latinos get upset when I bring up the concept of &#x201c;unconscious servitude&#x201d; (although they don&#x2019;t seem to mind the &#x201c;macho&#x201d; part as much). They assume I&#x2019;m putting down our value system. Nothing could be further from the truth. I love our conservative core values. I believe them. I embrace them. But I always press on.<br><br> &#x201c;Okay, tell me something. What did your parents teach you to say when an adult called your name?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Mande usted.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;What does &#x2018;mande usted&#x2019; mean?&#x201d; I ask.<br><br> &#x201c;It means, &#x2018;Yes?&#x2019; It&#x2019;s an acknowledgement.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Come on, what does it really mean? Think!&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;It means, &#x2018;Huh?&#x2019; Only much more respectful.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Think,&#x201d; I urge.<br><br> I spell it out. M-A-N-D-E&#x2014;M-E.<br><br> &#x201c;Command me? Order me?&#x201d;<br><br> Oops!<br><br> Have you ever heard an Anglo parent calling out to a child and the child responding, &#x201c;Order me?&#x201d; Of course not. Yet we Latinos say it every day. Gladly. Thinking we&#x2019;re being respectful. Kids respond to their elders that way. Workers to their bosses. Maids to the ladies of the house. It&#x2019;s so engrained, that even after we realize what we&#x2019;re saying, many of us keep right on saying it.<br><br> Other examples of this phenomenon:<br><br> A sus �rdenes, &#x201c;At your command.&#x201d;<br><br> Para servirle, &#x201c;Here to serve you.&#x201d;<br><br> Con su permiso, &#x201c;With your permission.&#x201d;<br><br> Como usted mande, &#x201c;As you command.&#x201d;<br><br> Por nada, &#x201c;For nothing,&#x201d; after Gracias or &#x201c;Thank you.&#x201d;<br><br> In Mexico, we&#x2019;re being respectful. In the United Sta...</p><h2>The Lore of Still Building</h2><p>In just a few short hours it will be within your power to construct your own efficient and economical still. You will be able to build a small still for the production of alcoholic beverages or a larger version for the production of fuel energy. Gasohol is only one of the many possible solutions to the fuel shortage explored in this single explosive volume. Home wine and beer-making are both legal in the United States, Canada and Great Britain. Home Distillation (operating a still) is not legal. Knowing how to distill is not illegal, but the Doing Is! However, a variance to the Distillation law can be obtained in the United States for the experimenter who wishes to build his own still for producing fuel. This variance does not allow the production of beverage alcohol although there is no difference between the two. Serious energy shortages have added even greater pressures for3 the releasing of the legal taboos on the freedom to distill. When such changes are legislated this informational book will then become a valuable textbook to the home distiller.</p><p>Norman Gibat is an Electronics Engineer. In 1966 he sold home wine and beer supplies. In 1968-1970 there was a small boom in making home wine and beer in the USA and Canada. Much of the material for this book was gathered prior to and during the period. <p>Kathleen Howard is a Programming Analyst. She was involved in the Home Wine, Beer and allied business while attending college at Oklahoma University in the 1960s. Much of her experience was gleaned through personal conversations with customers, a few of whom knew about distillation procedures in great detail because one or another of their parents were involved in "moonshining" as it was called in those days.</p></p>
